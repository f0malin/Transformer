0.14
 - catches overflow when calling timegm (fix error when using perl 5.8.0)

0.13
 - clears a Win32 warning when making %a = %c;

0.12
 - accepts hash-copy syntax:
     tie my %b, 'Date::Tie', %d;
     #     hash %d MUST be tied do Date::Tie, if you are using timezones
 - changed "int" to "floor" in month overflow; caused month-- to fail
     thanks to Henrique Pantarotto.

0.10 
 - accepts comma as fractional separator on input
 - read/write fractional hours, minutes, seconds, epoch. 
 - fractional days, months, years don't give an error, 
   but are always rounded to 'integer'.
 - corrections and additions to docs

0.09 
 - added 'frac' - fractional seconds
 - uses integer arithmetic to avoid rounding problems

0.08 
 - changing 'month' after changing 'day' would reset
   day to '1'
     thanks to Eduardo M. Cavalcanti.

 - I started this when dLux said:
> What about this kind of syntax:
> my $mydate = new XXXX::Date "2001-11-07";
> # somewhere later in the code
> my $duedate = $mydate + 14 * XXX::Date::DAY;
> my $duedate = $mydate + 14 * DAY;
> my $duedate = $mydate->add(12, DAYS);
> my $duedate = $mydate->add(day => 12);
> my $duedate = $mydate + "12 days";
> my $duedate = $mydate + "12 days and 4 hours and 3 seconds"; # :-)
