- update to new DateTime::Set specs
- more tests, revised README and TODO
- added a note on README about tests that may fail.
- use a slightly different density formula 
  for calculating the first element of a set.
  This should give a better distribution for 
  $set->next($dt) on an unbounded, uncached set -
  but only the first time it is called (this is 
  still in the TODO list)
