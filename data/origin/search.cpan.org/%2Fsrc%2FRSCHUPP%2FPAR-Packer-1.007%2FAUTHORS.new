With release 0.970 the once monolithic PAR distribution was split
into two separate distributions: PAR and PAR-Packer. The AUTHORS
file which lists the names of contributors is maintained as a single
file in the PAR distribution. You can most likely access the newest
version at the following URL or find it in the PAR distribution on
CPAN.
