=head1 NAME

TrulyRandom - Perl interface to a truly random number generator function

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Math::TrulyRandom;
    
    $random = truly_random_value();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<TrulyRandom> module provides an ability to generate truly random
numbers from within Perl programs.
The source of the randomness is from interrupt timing discrepancies.


=head1 EXAMPLE

    $random = truly_random_value();

=head1 BUGS

The random numbers take a long time (in computer terms) to generate,
so are only really useful for seeding pseudo random sequence generators.
