=head1 NAME

PAR::StrippedPARL::Dynamic - Data package containing a dynamic PARL

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # For details, see PAR::StrippedPARL::Base.
  PAR::StrippedPARL::Dynamic->write_parl($file) or die "Some error...";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is internal to PAR. Do not use it outside of PAR.

This class is basically just a container for a dynamic binary PAR loader
which doesn't include the PAR code like the F<parl> or F<parl.exe>
you are used to. If you're really curious, I'll tell you it is
just a copy of the F<myldr/par> (or F<myldr/par.exe>) file.

The data is appended during the C<make> phase of the PAR build process,
but only if applicable: If you perl is static, you won't get the dynamic
loader.

If the binary data isn't appended during the build process, the class
methods will return the empty list.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

Inherits the methods from L<PAR::StrippedPARL::Base>.
