     Revision 2.0  1998/05/28 10:24:58  byron
            -Version handling code.
            -Export symbol names.
            -How we handle the CGI object data.  Towit, we do some direct internal access for speed
             reasons.  Yes, I'm walking into CGI.pm's house without asking, so shoot me.  CGI.pm's
             data access methods are so needlessly slow it isn't even funny, but to change them
             would break the "documented" interface.  If this proves to be a problem later, I'll probably
             just bypass CGI.pm alltogether and do it myself.

             The old $Error code will still work the same, but there now are much
             cleaner ways to figure out exactly what happended and do something
             about it.
