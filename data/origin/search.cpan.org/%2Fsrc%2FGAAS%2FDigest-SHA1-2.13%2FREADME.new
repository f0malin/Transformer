The Digest::SHA1 module allows you to use the NIST SHA-1 message
digest algorithm from within Perl programs.  The algorithm takes as
input a message of arbitrary length and produces as output a 160-bit
"fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input.

SHA1 is described at <http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip180-1.htm>

You will need Perl version 5.004 or better to install this module.
