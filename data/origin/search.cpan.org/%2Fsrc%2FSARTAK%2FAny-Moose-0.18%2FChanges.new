0.16 2011-09-15
  * If you have Moose installed you no longer get the Mouse dependency (rjbs, reported by andk)
     Any::Moose has long had both runtime and test support for Moose
     without Mouse, but the toolchain has not, until recently, been
     good enough to handle alternatives. This change is designed
     to affect very few people.
