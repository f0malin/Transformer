This is the README file for Module::ScanDeps, a module to recursively
scan Perl programs for dependencies.

An application of Module::ScanDeps is to generate executables from scripts
that contains necessary modules; this module supports two such projects,
PAR and App::Packer.  Please see their respective documentations on CPAN
for further information.

    perl Makefile.PL
    make                # or 'nmake' on Win32
