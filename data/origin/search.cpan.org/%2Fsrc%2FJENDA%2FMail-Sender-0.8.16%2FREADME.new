Mail::Sender - module for sending mails with attachments through an SMTP server
Version 0.8.10
 by Jenda@Krynicky.cz
 http://Jenda.Krynicky.cz

Highlights:
 Since version 0.7.14 allows ESMTP authentication.
 Protocols builtin to Sender.pm : LOGIN, PLAIN, CRAM-MD5, NTLM
 You can add new supported protocols easily.

Known problems :
 The problem with multiline responses from some SMTP servers (namely qmail) is solved.

Future plans:
 I would like to rewrite the module completely to clean up the code and
 add better error handling. During that I'll add also timeouts and stuff.
 I don't know when will I have time to do that :-(
