Revision history for Perl extension Crypt::CBC.
2.29	 Tue Apr 22 10:22:37 EDT 2008
	 - Fixed errors that occurred when encrypting/decrypting utf8 strings
	 in Perl's more recent than 5.8.8.

2.28	 Mon Mar 31 10:46:25 EDT 2008
	 - Fixed bug in onesandzeroes test that causes it to fail with Rijndael module
 	 is not installed.

2.27	 Fri Mar 28 10:13:32 EDT 2008
 	 - When taint mode is turned on and user is using a tainted key, explicitly check
	   tainting of key in order to avoid "cryptic" failure messages from some crypt
	   modules.

2.26	Thu Mar 20 16:41:23 EDT 2008
	- Fixed onezeropadding test, which was not reporting its test count
	  properly.

2.25	Fri Jan 11 15:26:27 EST 2008
	- Fixed failure of oneandzeroes padding when plaintext size is
	an even multiple of blocksize.
	- Added new "rijndael_compat" padding method, which is compatible
	with the oneandzeroes padding method used by Crypt::Rijndael in
	CBC mode.

2.24	Fri Sep 28 11:21:07 EDT 2007
	- Fixed failure to run under taint checks with Crypt::Rijndael
	or Crypt::OpenSSL::AES (and maybe other Crypt modules). See 
	http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=29646.

2.23	Fri Apr 13 14:50:21 EDT 2007
	- Added checks for other implementations of CBC which add no
	standard padding at all when cipher text is an even multiple
	of the block size.

2.22	Sun Oct 29 16:50:32 EST 2006
	- Fixed bug in which plaintext encrypted with the -literal_key
	option could not be decrypted using a new object created with
	the same -literal_key.
 	- Added documentation confirming that -literal_key must be accompanied by a 
	-header of 'none' and a manually specificied IV.

2.21	Mon Oct 16 19:26:26 EDT 2006
	- Fixed bug in which new() failed to work when first option is -literal_key.

2.20	Sat Aug 12 22:30:53 EDT 2006
	- Added ability to pass a preinitialized Crypt::* block cipher object instead of
	the class name.
        - Fixed a bug when processing -literal_key.

2.19    Tue Jul 18 18:39:57 EDT 2006
	- Renamed Crypt::CBC-2.16-vulnerability.txt so that package installs correctly under
	Cygwin

2.18   2006/06/06 23:17:04
	- added more documentation describing how to achieve compatibility with old encrypted messages

2.17    Mon Jan  9 18:22:51 EST 2006
        -IMPORTANT NOTE: Versions of this module prior to 2.17 were incorrectly
	using 8 byte IVs when generating the old-style RandomIV style header
	(as opposed to the new-style random salt header). This affects data
        encrypted using the Rijndael algorithm, which has a 16 byte blocksize,
        and is a significant security issue.

        The bug has been corrected in versions 2.17 and higher by making it
        impossible to use 16-byte block ciphers with RandomIV headers. You may
        still read legacy encrypted data by explicitly passing the 
        -insecure_legacy_decrypt option to Crypt::CBC->new().

        -The salt, iv and key are now reset before each complete encryption
         cycle. This avoids inadvertent reuse of the same salt.

        -A new -header option has been added that allows you to select
         among the various types of headers, and avoids the ambiguity
         of having multiple interacting options.

        -A new random_bytes() method provides access to /dev/urandom on
         suitably-equipped hardware.

2.16	Tue Dec  6 14:17:45 EST 2005
	- Added two new options to new():
		-keysize   => <bytes>  Force the keysize -- useful for Blowfish
		-blocksize => <bytes>  Force the blocksize -- not known to be useful

		("-keysize=>16" is necessary to decrypt OpenSSL messages encrypted with
			Blowfish)

2.15	Thu Nov 17 17:34:28 EST 2005
	- -add_header=>0 now explicitly turns off any attempt of parsing the header
		in decrypt routines.

2.14	Thu May  5 16:08:15 EDT 2005
	- RandomIV in message header overrides manually-supplied -salt, as one
	would expect it should.

2.13	Fri Apr 22 13:01:32 EDT 200
	- Added OpenSSL compatibility
	- Salt and IV generators take advantage of /dev/urandom device, if available
	- Reorganized internal structure for coding clarity
	- Added regression test for PCBC mode

2.12	Thu Jun 17 11:52:04 EDT 2004
	- quenched (again) uninitialized variable warnings

2.11	Thu Jun  3 12:07:33 EDT 2004

	strings to not encrypt properly if ending in a "0" character.

2.09	Thu May 27 11:18:06 EDT 2004

2.05	Tue Jun 11 22:18:04 EDT 2002

	-Patch from Andy Turner <turner@mikomi.org> to allow backward
	compatibility with old versions when key length exceeded max.

2.02	Thu Jan 24 00:15:52 EST 2002
	- Default to pre-2.00 style padding, because Jody's default padding
		method was not binary safe.

2.01	Mon Dec 10 12:11:35 EST 2001
	- Removed debugging code.

2.00	Tue Oct 31, 2000
	- Patches for foreign program compatibility, initialization vectors
		and padding methods from Jody Biggs <jody.biggs@paymybills.com>

1.25    Thu Jun  8 11:56:28 EDT 2000
	- Bug fix didn't get into version 1.24.  Is in version 1.25

1.24    Tue Jun  6 17:35:18 EDT 2000
	- Fixed a bug that prevented a DES and an IDEA object from being
		used simultaneously.

1.22	Wed Jan 26 19:07:30 EST 2000
	- Added support for Crypt::Blowfish (available from www.cryptix.org)
	- Fixed failure to encrypt data files < 8 bytes
	- Fixed -w warning when decrypting data files < 8 bytes

1.20  Sun Dec 20 3:58:01 1998 MET
	- Folded in bug fixes from Devin Carraway <aqua@sonic.net>
	(chiefly having to do with finish() being called with a
	zero-length buffer).

1.10  Thu Sep 11 09:15:01 1998
	- Changed package name to Crypt::CBC

1.00  Tue Jun 16 07:37:35 1998
