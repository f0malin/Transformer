<p>This module works under the Apache Web Server with the mod_perl module enabled. See <a href="http://www.apache.org" class="podlinkurl"
>http://www.apache.org</a> and <a href="http://perl.apache.org" class="podlinkurl"
>http://perl.apache.org</a> for further information.</p>

<p>This is a portable solution, similar to ActiveState&#39;s PerlScript for NT/IIS ASP. Work has been done and will continue to make ports to and from this implementation as smooth as possible.</p>

<p>For Apache::ASP downloading and installation, please read the INSTALL section. For installation troubleshooting check the FAQ and the SUPPORT sections.</p>

<p>For database access, ActiveX, scripting languages, and other miscellaneous issues please read the FAQ section.</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="WEBSITE"
>WEBSITE <img alt='^' src='http://st.pimg.net/tucs/img/up.gif'></a></h1>

<p>The Apache::ASP web site is at <a href="http://www.apache-asp.org/" class="podlinkurl"
>http://www.apache-asp.org/</a> which you can also find in the ./site directory of the source distribution.</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="INSTALL"
>INSTALL <img alt='^' src='http://st.pimg.net/tucs/img/up.gif'></a></h1>

<p>The installation process for Apache::ASP is geared towards those with experience with Perl, Apache, and unix systems. For those without this experience, please understand that the learning curve can be significant. But what you have at the end will be a web site running on superior open source software.</p>

<p>If installing onto a Windows operating system, please see the section titled Win32 Install.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Need_Help"
>Need Help</a></h2>

<p>Often, installing the mod_perl part of the Apache server can be the hardest part. If this is the case for you, check out the FAQ and SUPPORT sections for further help, as well as the &#34;Build Apache&#34; notes in this section.</p>

<p>Please also see the mod_perl guide at <a href="http://perl.apache.org/guide" class="podlinkurl"
>http://perl.apache.org/guide</a> which one ought to give a good read before undertaking a mod_perl project.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Download_and_CPAN_Install"
>Download and CPAN Install</a></h2>

<p>You may download the latest Apache::ASP from your nearest CPAN, and also:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  <a href="http://cpan.org/modules/by-module/Apache/" class="podlinkurl"
>http://cpan.org/modules/by-module/Apache/</a>
  <a href="ftp://ftp.duke.edu/pub/perl/modules/by-module/Apache/" class="podlinkurl"
>ftp://ftp.duke.edu/pub/perl/modules/by-module/Apache/</a></pre>

<p>As a Perl developer, you should make yourself familiar with the CPAN.pm module, and how it may be used to install Apache::ASP, and other related modules. The easiest way to install Apache::ASP for the first time from Perl is to fire up the CPAN shell like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> shell prompt&#62; perl -MCPAN -e shell
  ... configure CPAN ...
  ... then upgrade to latest CPAN ...
 cpan&#62; install CPAN
  ...
 cpan&#62; install Bundle::Apache::ASP</pre>

<p>Installing the Apache::ASP bundle will automatically install all the modules Apache::ASP is dependent on as well as Apache::ASP itself. If you have trouble installing the bundle, then try installing the necessary modules one at a time:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> cpan&#62; install MLDBM
 cpan&#62; install MLDBM::Sync
 cpan&#62; install Digest::MD5  *** may not be needed for perl 5.8+ ***
 cpan&#62; install Apache::ASP</pre>

<p>For extra/optional functionality in Apache::ASP 2.31 or greater, like support for FormFill, XSLT, or SSI, you can install this bundle via CPAN:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  cpan&#62; install Bundle::Apache::ASP::Extra</pre>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Regular_Perl_Module_Install"
>Regular Perl Module Install</a></h2>

<p>If not doing the CPAN install, download Apache::ASP and install it using the make or nmake commands as shown below. Otherwise, just copy ASP.pm to $PERLLIB/site/Apache</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  &#62; perl Makefile.PL
  &#62; make 
  &#62; make test
  &#62; make install

  * use nmake for win32</pre>

<p>Please note that you must first have the Apache Web Server &#38; mod_perl installed before using this module in a web server environment. The offline mode for building static html at ./cgi/asp may be used with just perl.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Win32_/_Windows_Install"
>Win32 / Windows Install</a></h2>

<p>If you are on a Win32 platform, like WinNT or Windows 2000, you can download the win32 binaries linked to from:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  <a href="http://perl.apache.org/distributions.html" class="podlinkurl"
>http://perl.apache.org/distributions.html</a>  </pre>

<p>From here, I would recommend the mod_perl binary installation at:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  <a href="ftp://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/pub/other/" class="podlinkurl"
>ftp://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/pub/other/</a></pre>

<p>and install the latest perl-win32-bin-*.exe file.</p>

<p>Randy Kobes has graciously provided these, which include compiled versions perl, mod_perl, apache, mod_ssl, as well as all the modules required by Apache::ASP and Apache::ASP itself.</p>

<p>You may also try the more recent Perl-5.8-win32-bin.exe distribution which is built on Apache 2. This should be treated as BETA release software until mod_perl 2.x is released as stable. Some notes from Randy Kobes about getting this release to work are here:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  After installing this distribution, in Apache2\conf\perl.conf
  (pulled in via Apache2\conf\httpd.conf) there&#39;s directives that
  have Apache::ASP handle files placed under the Apache2\asp\
  directory. There should be a sample Apache::ASP script there,
  printenv.html, accessed as <a href="http://127.0.0.1/asp/printenv.html" class="podlinkurl"
>http://127.0.0.1/asp/printenv.html</a>
  which, if working, will print out your environment variables.</pre>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="WinME_/_98_/_95_flock()_workaround"
>WinME / 98 / 95 flock() workaround</a></h2>

<p>For those on desktop Windows operation systems, Apache::ASP v2.25 and later needs a special work around for the lack of flock() support on these systems. Please add this to your Apache httpd.conf to fix this problem after mod_perl is installed:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  &#60;Perl&#62;
   *CORE::GLOBAL::flock = sub { 1 };
  &#60;/Perl&#62;
  PerlModule  Apache::ASP</pre>

<p>Please be sure to add this configuration before Apache::ASP is loaded via PerlModule, or a PerlRequire statement.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Linux_DSO_Distributions"
>Linux DSO Distributions</a></h2>

<p>If you have a linux distribution, like a RedHat Linux server, with an RPM style Apache + mod_perl, seriously consider building a static version of the httpd server yourself, not DSO. DSO is marked as experimental for mod_perl, and often does not work, resulting in &#34;no request object&#34; error messages, and other oddities, and are terrible to debug, because of the strange kinds of things that can go wrong.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Build_Apache_and_mod_perl"
>Build Apache and mod_perl</a></h2>

<p>For a quick build of apache, there is a script in the distribution at ./make_httpd/build_httpds.sh that can compile a statically linked Apache with mod_ssl and mod_perl. Just drop the sources into the make_httpd directory, configure the environments as appropriate, and execute the script like this:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> make_httpd&#62; ./build_httpds.sh</pre>

<p>You might also find helpful a couple items:</p>

<p>Once you have successfully built the Apache Web Server with mod_perl, copy the ./site/eg/ directory from the Apache::ASP installation to your Apache document tree and try it out! You must put &#34;AllowOverride All&#34; in your httpd.conf &#60;Directory&#62; config section to let the .htaccess file in the ./site/eg installation directory do its work. If you want a starter config file for Apache::ASP, just look at the .htaccess file in the ./site/eg/ directory.</p>

<p>So, you might add this to your Apache httpd.conf file just to get the scripts in ./site/eg working, where $DOCUMENT_ROOT represents the DocumentRoot config for your apache server:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  &#60;Directory $DOCUMENT_ROOT/asp/eg &#62;
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
  &#60;/Directory&#62;</pre>

<p>To copy the entire site, including the examples, you might do a raw directory copy as in:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  shell&#62; cp -rpd ./site $DOCUMENT_ROOT/asp</pre>

<p>So you could then reference the Apache::ASP docs at /asp/ at your site, and the examples at /asp/eg/ .</p>

<p>This is not a good production configuration, because it is insecure with the FollowSymLinks, and tells Apache to look for .htaccess which is bad for performance but it should be handy for getting started with development.</p>

<p>You will know that Apache::ASP is working normally if you can run the scripts in ./site/eg/ without any errors. Common problems can be found in the FAQ section.</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="CONFIG"
>CONFIG <img alt='^' src='http://st.pimg.net/tucs/img/up.gif'></a></h1>

<p>You may use a &#60;Files ...&#62; directive in your httpd.conf Apache configuration file to make Apache::ASP start ticking. Configure the optional settings if you want, the defaults are fine to get started. The settings are documented below. Make sure Global is set to where your web applications global.asa is if you have one!</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> PerlModule  Apache::ASP
 &#60;Files ~ (\.asp)&#62;    
   SetHandler  perl-script
   PerlHandler Apache::ASP
   PerlSetVar  Global .
   PerlSetVar  StateDir /tmp/asp
 &#60;/Files&#62;</pre>

<p>NOTE: do not use this for the examples in ./site/eg. To get the examples working, check out the Quick Start section of INSTALL</p>

<p>You may use other Apache configuration tags like &#60;Directory&#62;, &#60;Location&#62;, and &#60;VirtualHost&#62;, to separately define ASP configurations, but using the &#60;Files&#62; tag is natural for ASP application building because it lends itself naturally to mixed media per directory. For building many separate ASP sites, you might want to use separate .htaccess files, or &#60;Files&#62; tags in &#60;VirtualHost&#62; sections, the latter being better for performance.</p>

By default, GlobalPackage is some obscure name that is uniquely generated from the file path of the Global directory, and global.asa file. The use of explicitly naming the GlobalPackage is to allow scripts access to globals and subs defined in a perl module that is included with commands like:</p>

<p>By default, ASP scripts in a web application are compiled into the *same* perl package, so these scripts, their includes, and the global.asa events all share common globals &#38; subroutines defined by each other. The problem for some developers was that they would at times define a subroutine of the same name in 2+ scripts, and one subroutine definition would redefine the other one because of the namespace collision.</p>

<p>The default has not changed since implementing this config directive. The reason for this config option is to allow operating systems with caching file systems like Solaris to specify a state directory separately from the Global directory, which contains more permanent files.

<p>With lightweight $Session and $Application use, you can get away with SDBM_File, but if you load it up with complex data like $Session{key} = { # very large complex object } you might max out the 1024 limit.</p>

<p>Currently StateDB can be: SDBM_File, MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File, DB_File, and GDBM_File. Please let me know if you would like to add any more to this list.</p>

<p>As of version .18, you may change this setting in a live production environment, and new state databases created will be of this format.

<p>This config option was implemented to be a smooth upgrade, as you can turn it off and on, without disrupting current sessions. Sessions must be created with this turned on for the security to take effect.</p>

<p>This config option is to help prevent a brute force cookie search from being successful. The number of possible cookies is huge, 2^128, thus making such a hacking attempt VERY unlikely. However, on the off chance that such an attack is successful, the hacker must also present identical browser headers to authenticate the session, or the session will be destroyed. Thus the User-Agent acts as a backup to the real session id. The IP address of the browser cannot be used, since because of proxies, IP addresses may change between requests during a session.</p>

<p>There are a few browsers that will not present a User-Agent header. These browsers are considered to be browsers of type &#34;Unknown&#34;, and this method works the same way for them.</p>

<p>Although this runtime parsing method is computationally expensive, this cost should be amortized across most users that will not need this URL parsing. This is a lazy programmer&#39;s dream.

<p>API extension to generate local URLs with session ids in their query strings, for efficient cookieless session support.

>Caching</a></h2>

<p>The output caching layer is a file dbm based output cache that runs on top of the MLDBM::Sync so inherits its performance characteristics. With CacheDB set to MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File, the cache layer is very fast at caching entries up to 20K in size, but for greater cached items, you should set CacheDB to another dbm like DB_File or GDBM_File.</p>

<p>In order for the cache layer to function properly, whether for $Response-&#62;Include() output caching, see OBJECTS, or XSLT caching, see XML/XSLT, then Apache::ASP must be loaded in the parent httpd like so:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  # httpd.conf
  PerlModule Apache::ASP
    -- or --
  &#60;Perl&#62;
    use Apache::ASP;
  &#60;/Perl&#62;</pre>

<p>The cache layer automatically expires entries upon server restart, but for this to work, a $ServerID must be computed when the Apache::ASP module gets loaded to store in each cached item. Without the above done, each child httpd process will get its own $ServerID, so caching will not work at all.</p>

<p>This said, output caching will not work in raw CGI mode, just running under mod_perl.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="CacheDB"
>CacheDB</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Like StateDB, sets dbm format for caching. Since SDBM_File only support key/values pairs of around 1K max in length, the default for this is MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File, which is very fast for &#60; 20K output sizes. For caching larger data than 20K, DB_File or GDBM_File are probably better to use.</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  PerlSetVar CacheDB MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File</pre>

Here are some benchmarks about the CacheDB when used 
with caching output from $Response->Include(\%cache)
running on a Linux 2.2.14 dual PIII-450. 
The variables are output size being cached & the CacheDB used,
the default being MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File. 


<table class="noescape" border="0">

<dd>
<p>By default, the cache directory is at StateDir/cache, but CacheDir can be used to set the StateDir value for caching purposes. One may want the CacheDir separate from StateDir for example StateDir might be a centrally network mounted file system, while CacheDir might be a local file cache.</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  PerlSetVar CacheDir /tmp/asp_demo</pre>

<p>On a system like Solaris where there is a RAM disk mounted on the system like /tmp, I could put the CacheDir there. On a system like Linux where files are cached pretty well by default, this is less important.</p>

<dt><a name="CacheSize"
>CacheSize</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>By default, this is 10M of data per cache. When any cache, like the XSLTCache, reaches this limit, the cache will be purged by deleting the cached dbm files entirely. This is better for long term running of dbms than deleting individual records, because dbm formats will often degrade in performance with lots of insert &#38; deletes.</p>

<p>Units of M, K, and B are supported for megabytes, kilobytes, and bytes, with the default unit being B, so the following configs all mean the same thing;</p>

<p>The StatINCMatch setting should be a regular expression like: Struct|LWP which would match on reloading Class/Struct.pm, and all the LWP/.* libraries.</p>

<p>default 1, if set to 0, changed scripts, global.asa, and includes will not be reloaded. Coupled with Apache mod_perl startup and restart handlers executing Apache::ASP-&#62;Loader() for your application this allows your application to be frozen, and only reloaded on the next server restart or stop/start.</p>

<p>There are a few advantages for not reloading scripts and modules in production. First there is a slight performance improvement by not having to stat() the script, its includes and the global.asa every request.</p>

<p>From an application deployment standpoint, you also gain the ability to deploy your application as a snapshot taken when the server starts and restarts. This provides you with the reassurance that during a production server update from development sources, you do not have to worry with sources being used for the wrong libraries and such, while they are all being copied over.</p>

<p>Finally, though you really should not do this, you can work on a live production application, with a test server reloading changes, but your production server does see the changes until you restart or stop/start it. This saves your public from syntax errors while you are just doing a quick bug fix.</p>

<p>You may only use this option with modperl v1.16 or greater installed and PERL_STACKED_HANDLERS enabled. Filtering may be used in conjunction with other handlers that are also &#34;filter aware&#34;. If in doubt, try building your mod_perl with</p>

This will come at a 5%-20% hit to CPU usage per request compressed.</p>

<p>Note there are some cases when a browser says it will accept gzip encoding, but then not render it correctly. This behavior has been seen with IE5 when set to use a proxy but not using a proxy, and the URL does not end with a .html or .htm.

<p>ASP embedding syntax allows one to embed code in html in 2 simple ways. The first is the &#60;% xxx %&#62; tag in which xxx is any valid perl code. The second is &#60;%= xxx %&#62; where xxx is some scalar value that will be inserted into the html directly. An easy print.</p>

<p>The ASP platform allows developers to create Web Applications. In fulfillment of real software requirements, ASP allows event-triggered actions to be taken, which are defined in a global.asa file. The global.asa file resides in the Global directory, defined as a config option, and may define the following actions:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">        Action                  Event
        ------                  ------
        Script_OnStart *        Beginning of Script execution
        Script_OnEnd *          End of Script execution
        Script_OnFlush *        Before $Response being flushed to client.
        Script_OnParse *        Before script compilation
        Application_OnStart     Beginning of Application
        Application_OnEnd       End of Application
        Session_OnStart         Beginning of user Session.
        Session_OnEnd           End of user Session.

  * These are API extensions that are not portable, but were
    added because they are incredibly useful</pre>

<p>These actions must be defined in the $Global/global.asa file as subroutines, for example:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  sub Session_OnStart {
      $Application-&#62;{$Session-&#62;SessionID()} = started;
  }</pre>

<p>Sessions are easy to understand. When visiting a page in a web application, each user has one unique $Session. This session expires, after which the user will have a new $Session upon revisiting.</p>

<p>A web application starts when the user visits a page in that application, and has a new $Session created. Right before the first $Session is created, the $Application is created. When the last user $Session expires, that $Application expires also. For some web applications that are always busy, the Application_OnEnd event may never occur.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Script_OnStart_&#38;_Script_OnEnd"
>Script_OnStart &#38; Script_OnEnd</a></h2>

<p>The script events are used to run any code for all scripts in an application defined by a global.asa. Often, you would like to run the same code for every script, which you would otherwise have to add by hand, or add with a file include, but with these events, just add your code to the global.asa, and it will be run.</p>

<p>There is one caveat. Code in Script_OnEnd is not guaranteed to be run when $Response-&#62;End() is called, since the program execution ends immediately at this event. To always run critical code, use the API extension:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">        $Server-&#62;RegisterCleanup()</pre>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Session_OnStart"
>Session_OnStart</a></h2>

<p>Triggered by the beginning of a user&#39;s session, Session_OnStart gets run before the user&#39;s executing script, and if the same session recently timed out, after the session&#39;s triggered Session_OnEnd.</p>

<p>The Session_OnStart is particularly useful for caching database data, and avoids having the caching handled by clumsy code inserted into each script being executed.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Session_OnEnd"
>Session_OnEnd</a></h2>

<p>Triggered by a user session ending, Session_OnEnd can be useful for cleaning up and analyzing user data accumulated during a session.</p>

<p>Sessions end when the session timeout expires, and the StateManager performs session cleanup. The timing of the Session_OnEnd does not occur immediately after the session times out, but when the first script runs after the session expires, and the StateManager allows for that session to be cleaned up.</p>

<p>So on a busy site with default SessionTimeout (20 minutes) and StateManager (10 times) settings, the Session_OnEnd for a particular session should be run near 22 minutes past the last activity that Session saw. A site infrequently visited will only have the Session_OnEnd run when a subsequent visit occurs, and theoretically the last session of an application ever run will never have its Session_OnEnd run.</p>

<p>Thus I would not put anything mission-critical in the Session_OnEnd, just stuff that would be nice to run whenever it gets run.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'

>Script_OnFlush</a></h2>

<p>API extension. This event will be called prior to flushing the $Response buffer to the web client. At this time, the $Response-&#62;{BinaryRef} buffer reference may be used to modify the buffered output at runtime to apply global changes to scripts output without having to modify all the scripts.</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> sub Script_OnFlush {
   my $ref = $Response-&#62;{BinaryRef};
   $$ref =~ s/\s+/ /sg; # to strip extra white space
 }</pre>

<p>Check out the ./site/eg/global.asa for an example of its use.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Script_OnParse"
>Script_OnParse</a></h2>

<p>This event allows one to set up a source filter on the script text, allowing one to change the script on the fly before the compilation stage occurs. The script text is available in the $Server-&#62;{ScriptRef} scalar reference, and can be accessed like so:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> sub Script_OnParse {
   my $code = $Server-&#62;{ScriptRef}
   $$code .= &#34; ADDED SOMETHING &#34;;
 }</pre>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Application_OnStart"
>Application_OnStart</a></h2>

<p>This event marks the beginning of an ASP application, and is run just before the Session_OnStart of the first Session of an application. This event is useful to load up $Application with data that will be used in all user sessions.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Application_OnEnd"
>Application_OnEnd</a></h2>

<p>The end of the application is marked by this event, which is run after the last user session has timed out for a given ASP application.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Server_OnStart_(_pseudo-event_)"
>Server_OnStart ( pseudo-event )</a></h2>

<p>Some might want something like a Server_OnStart event, where some code gets runs when the web server starts. In mod_perl, this is easy to achieve outside of the scope of an ASP application, by putting some initialization code into a &#60;Perl&#62; section in the httpd.conf file. Initializations that you would like to be shared with the child httpds are particularly useful, one such being the Apache::ASP-&#62;Loader() routine which you can read more about in the TUNING section - Precompile Scripts subsection. It is could be called like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  # httpd.conf
  &#60;Perl&#62;
     Apache::ASP-&#62;Loader($path, $pattern, %config)
  &#60;/Perl&#62;</pre>

<p>So a &#60;Perl&#62; section is your Server_OnStart routine!</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="mod_perl_handlers"
>mod_perl handlers</a></h2>

<p>If one wants to extend one&#39;s environment with mod_perl handlers, Apache::ASP does not stop this. Basic use of Apache::ASP in fact only involves the content handler phase of mod_perl&#39;s PerlHandler, like</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  SetHandler perl-script
  PerlModule Apache::ASP
  PerlHandler Apache::ASP </pre>

<p>But mod_perl allows for direct access to many more Apache event stages, for full list try &#34;perldoc mod_perl&#34; or buy the mod_perl Eagle book. Some commonly used ones are:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  PerlInitHandler
  PerlTransHandler
  PerlFixupHandler
  PerlHandler
  PerlLogHandler
  PerlCleanupHandler</pre>

<p>For straight Apache::ASP programming, there are some equivalents, say Script_OnStart event instead of Init/Fixup stages, or $Server-&#62;RegisterCleanup() for Log/Cleanup stages, but you can do things in the mod_perl handlers that you cannot do in Apache::ASP, especially if you want to handle all files globally, and not just ASP scripts.</p>

<p>For many Apache::* modules for use with mod_perl, of which Apache::ASP is just one, check out <a href="http://perl.apache.org/src/apache-modlist.html" class="podlinkurl"
>http://perl.apache.org/src/apache-modlist.html</a></p>

<p>To gain access to the ASP objects like $Session outside in a non-PerlHandler mod_perl handler, you may use this API:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  my $ASP = Apache::ASP-&#62;new($r); # $r is Apache-&#62;request object</pre>

<p>as in this possible Authen handler:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  &#60;Perl&#62;
    use Apache::ASP;
    sub My::Auth::handler {
      my $r = shift;
      my $ASP = Apache::ASP-&#62;new($r) 
      my $Session = $ASP-&#62;Session;
    }
  &#60;/Perl&#62;</pre>

<p>Here are some examples of do-it-yourself mod_perl handler programming...</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> === Forbid Bad HSlide User Agent ===

 # httpd.conf

 &#60;Perl&#62;

   }
 &#60;/Perl&#62;

<p>The beauty of the ASP Object Model is that it takes the burden of CGI and Session Management off the developer, and puts them in objects accessible from any ASP script &#38; include. For the perl programmer, treat these objects as globals accessible from anywhere in your ASP application.</p>

<p>The Apache::ASP object model supports the following:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  Object         Function
  ------         --------
  $Session      - user session state
  $Response     - output to browser
  $Request      - input from browser
  $Application  - application state
  $Server       - general methods</pre>

<p>These objects, and their methods are further defined in the following sections.</p>

<p>If you would like to define your own global objects for use in your scripts and includes, you can initialize them in the global.asa Script_OnStart like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> use vars qw( $Form $Site ); # declare globals
 sub Script_OnStart {
     $Site = My::Site-&#62;new;  # init $Site object
     $Form = $Request-&#62;Form; # alias form data
     $Server-&#62;RegisterCleanup(sub { # garbage collection
                                  $Site-&#62;DESTROY; 
                                  $Site = $Form = undef; 
                              });
 }</pre>

<p>In this way you can create site wide application objects and simple aliases for common functions.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="$Session_Object"
>$Session Object</a></h2>

<p>The $Session object keeps track of user and web client state, in a persistent manner, making it relatively easy to develop web applications. The $Session state is stored across HTTP connections, in database files in the Global or StateDir directories, and will persist across web server restarts.</p>

<p>The user session is referenced by a 128 bit / 32 byte MD5 hex hashed cookie, and can be considered secure from session id guessing, or session hijacking. When a hacker fails to guess a session, the system times out for a second, and with 2**128 (3.4e38) keys to guess, a hacker will not be guessing an id any time soon.</p>

<p>If an incoming cookie matches a timed out or non-existent session, a new session is created with the incoming id. If the id matches a currently active session, the session is tied to it and returned. This is also similar to the Microsoft ASP implementation.</p>

<p>The $Session reference is a hash ref, and can be used as such to store data as in:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">    $Session-&#62;{count}++;        # increment count by one
    %{$Session} = ();   # clear $Session data</pre>

<p>The $Session object state is implemented through MLDBM, and a user should be aware of the limitations of MLDBM. Basically, you can read complex structures, but not write them, directly:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  $data = $Session-&#62;{complex}{data};     # Read ok.
  $Session-&#62;{complex}{data} = $data;     # Write NOT ok.
  $Session-&#62;{complex} = {data =&#62; $data}; # Write ok, all at once.</pre>

<p>Please see MLDBM for more information on this topic. $Session can also be used for the following methods and properties:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name='Session'></a><a name="$Session-&#62;{CodePage}"
>$Session-&#62;{CodePage}</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Not implemented. May never be until someone needs it.</p>

<dt><a name='Session'></a><a name="$Session-&#62;{LCID}"
>$Session-&#62;{LCID}</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Not implemented. May never be until someone needs it.</p>

<dt><a name='Session'></a><a name="$Session-&#62;{SessionID}"
>$Session-&#62;{SessionID}</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>SessionID property, returns the id for the current session, which is exchanged between the client and the server as a cookie.</p>

<dt><a name='Session'></a><a name="$Session-&#62;{Timeout}_[=_$minutes]"
>$Session-&#62;{Timeout} [= $minutes]</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Timeout property, if minutes is being assigned, sets this default timeout for the user session, else returns the current session timeout.</p>

<p>If a user session is inactive for the full timeout, the session is destroyed by the system. No one can access the session after it times out, and the system garbage collects it eventually.</p>

<dt><a name='Session'></a><a name="$Session-&#62;Abandon()"
>$Session-&#62;Abandon()</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>The abandon method times out the session immediately. All Session data is cleared in the process, just as when any session times out.</p>

<dt><a name='Session'></a><a name="$Session-&#62;Lock()"
>$Session-&#62;Lock()</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>API extension. If you are about to use $Session for many consecutive reads or writes, you can improve performance by explicitly locking $Session, and then unlocking, like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  $Session-&#62;Lock();
  $Session-&#62;{count}++;
  $Session-&#62;{count}++;
  $Session-&#62;{count}++;
  $Session-&#62;UnLock();  </pre>

<p>This sequence causes $Session to be locked and unlocked only 1 time, instead of the 6 times that it would be locked otherwise, 2 for each increment with one to read and one to write.</p>

<p>Because of flushing issues with SDBM_File and DB_File databases, each lock actually ties fresh to the database, so the performance savings here can be considerable.</p>

<p>Note that if you have SessionSerialize set, $Session is already locked for each script invocation automatically, as if you had called $Session-&#62;Lock() in Script_OnStart. Thus you do not need to worry about $Session locking for performance. Please read the section on SessionSerialize for more info.</p>

<dt><a name='Session'></a><a name="$Session-&#62;UnLock()"
>$Session-&#62;UnLock()</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>API Extension. Unlocks the $Session explicitly. If you do not call this, $Session will be unlocked automatically at the end of the script.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="$Response_Object"
>$Response Object</a></h2>

<p>This object manages the output from the ASP Application and the client web browser. It does not store state information like the $Session object but does have a wide array of methods to call.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;{BinaryRef}"
>$Response-&#62;{BinaryRef}</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>API extension. This is a perl reference to the buffered output of the $Response object, and can be used in the Script_OnFlush global.asa event to modify the buffered output at runtime to apply global changes to scripts output without having to modify all the scripts. These changes take place before content is flushed to the client web browser.</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> sub Script_OnFlush {
   my $ref = $Response-&#62;{BinaryRef};
   $$ref =~ s/\s+/ /sg; # to strip extra white space
 }</pre>

<p>Check out the ./site/eg/global.asa for an example of its use.</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;{Buffer}"
>$Response-&#62;{Buffer}</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Default 1, when TRUE sends output from script to client only at the end of processing the script. When 0, response is not buffered, and client is sent output as output is generated by the script.</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;{CacheControl}"
>$Response-&#62;{CacheControl}</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Default &#34;private&#34;, when set to public allows proxy servers to cache the content. This setting controls the value set in the HTTP header Cache-Control</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;{Charset}"
>$Response-&#62;{Charset}</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>This member when set appends itself to the value of the Content-Type HTTP header. If $Response-&#62;{Charset} = &#39;ISO-LATIN-1&#39; is set, the corresponding header would look like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-LATIN-1</pre>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;{Clean}_=_0-9;"
>$Response-&#62;{Clean} = 0-9;</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>API extension. Set the Clean level, default 0, on a per script basis. Clean of 1-9 compresses text/html output. Please see the Clean config option for more information. This setting may also be useful even if using compression to obfuscate HTML.</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;{ContentType}_=_&#34;text/html&#34;"
>$Response-&#62;{ContentType} = &#34;text/html&#34;</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Sets the MIME type for the current response being sent to the client. Sent as an HTTP header.</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;{Debug}_=_1|0"
>$Response-&#62;{Debug} = 1|0</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>API extension. Default set to value of Debug config. May be used to temporarily activate or inactivate $Response-&#62;Debug() behavior. Something like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> {
   local $Response-&#62;{Debug} = 1;
   $Response-&#62;Debug($values);
 }</pre>

<p>maybe be used to always log something. The Debug() method can be better than AppendToLog() because it will log data in data structures one level deep, whereas AppendToLog prints just raw string/scalar values.</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;{Expires}_=_$time"
>$Response-&#62;{Expires} = $time</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Sends a response header to the client indicating the $time in SECONDS in which the document should expire. A time of 0 means immediate expiration. The header generated is a standard HTTP date like: &#34;Wed, 09 Feb 1994 22:23:32 GMT&#34;.</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;{ExpiresAbsolute}_=_$date"
>$Response-&#62;{ExpiresAbsolute} = $date</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Sends a response header to the client with $date being an absolute time to expire. Formats accepted are all those accepted by HTTP::Date::str2time(), e.g.</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> &#34;Wed, 09 Feb 1994 22:23:32 GMT&#34;     -- HTTP format
 &#34;Tuesday, 08-Feb-94 14:15:29 GMT&#34;   -- old rfc850 HTTP format

 &#34;08-Feb-94&#34;       -- old rfc850 HTTP format    
 &#34;09 Feb 1994&#34;     -- proposed new HTTP format  

 &#34;Feb  3  1994&#34;    -- Unix &#39;ls -l&#39; format
 &#34;Feb  3 17:03&#34;    -- Unix &#39;ls -l&#39; format</pre>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;{FormFill}_=_0|1"
>$Response-&#62;{FormFill} = 0|1</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>If true, HTML forms generated by the script output will be auto filled with data from $Request-&#62;Form. This feature requires HTML::FillInForm to be installed. Please see the FormFill CONFIG for more information.</p>

<p>This setting overrides the FormFill config at runtime for the script execution only.</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;{IsClientConnected}"
>$Response-&#62;{IsClientConnected}</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>1 if web client is connected, 0 if not. This value starts set to 1, and will be updated whenever a $Response-&#62;Flush() is called. If BufferingOn is set, by default $Response-&#62;Flush() will only be called at the end of the HTML output.</p>

<p>As of version 2.23 this value is updated correctly before global.asa Script_OnStart is called, so global script termination may be correctly handled during that event, which one might want to do with excessive user STOP/RELOADS when the web server is very busy.</p>

<p>An API extension $Response-&#62;IsClientConnected may be called for refreshed connection status without calling first a $Response-&#62;Flush</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;{PICS}"
>$Response-&#62;{PICS}</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>If this property has been set, a PICS-Label HTTP header will be sent with its value. For those that do not know, PICS is a header that is useful in rating the internet. It stands for Platform for Internet Content Selection, and you can find more info about it at: <a href="http://www.w3.org" class="podlinkurl"
>http://www.w3.org</a></p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;{Status}_=_$status"
>$Response-&#62;{Status} = $status</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Sets the status code returned by the server. Can be used to set messages like 500, internal server error</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;AddHeader($name,_$value)"
>$Response-&#62;AddHeader($name, $value)</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Adds a custom header to a web page. Headers are sent only before any text from the main page is sent, so if you want to set a header after some text on a page, you must turn BufferingOn.</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;AppendToLog($message)"
>$Response-&#62;AppendToLog($message)</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Adds $message to the server log. Useful for debugging.</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;BinaryWrite($data)"
>$Response-&#62;BinaryWrite($data)</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Writes binary data to the client. The only difference from $Response-&#62;Write() is that $Response-&#62;Flush() is called internally first, so the data cannot be parsed as an html header. Flushing flushes the header if has not already been written.</p>

<p>If you have set the $Response-&#62;{ContentType} to something other than text/html, cgi header parsing (see CGI notes), will be automatically be turned off, so you will not necessarily need to use BinaryWrite for writing binary data.</p>

<p>For an example of BinaryWrite, see the binary_write.htm example in ./site/eg/binary_write.htm</p>

<p>Please note that if you are on Win32, you will need to call binmode on a file handle before reading, if its data is binary.</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;Clear()"
>$Response-&#62;Clear()</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Erases buffered ASP output.</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;Cookies($name,_[$key,]_$value)"
>$Response-&#62;Cookies($name, [$key,] $value)</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Sets the key or attribute of cookie with name $name to the value $value. If $key is not defined, the Value of the cookie is set. ASP CookiePath is assumed to be / in these examples.</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> $Response-&#62;Cookies(&#39;name&#39;, &#39;value&#39;); 
  --&#62; Set-Cookie: name=value; path=/

 $Response-&#62;Cookies(&#34;Test&#34;, &#34;data1&#34;, &#34;test value&#34;);     
 $Response-&#62;Cookies(&#34;Test&#34;, &#34;data2&#34;, &#34;more test&#34;);      
 $Response-&#62;Cookies(
        &#34;Test&#34;, &#34;Expires&#34;, 
        &#38;HTTP::Date::time2str(time+86400)
        ); 
 $Response-&#62;Cookies(&#34;Test&#34;, &#34;Secure&#34;, 1);               
 $Response-&#62;Cookies(&#34;Test&#34;, &#34;Path&#34;, &#34;/&#34;);
 $Response-&#62;Cookies(&#34;Test&#34;, &#34;Domain&#34;, &#34;host.com&#34;);
  --&#62;   Set-Cookie:Test=data1=test%20value&#38;data2=more%20test;   \
                expires=Fri, 23 Apr 1999 07:19:52 GMT;          \
                path=/; domain=host.com; secure</pre>

<p>The latter use of $key in the cookies not only sets cookie attributes such as Expires, but also treats the cookie as a hash of key value pairs which can later be accesses by</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> $Request-&#62;Cookies(&#39;Test&#39;, &#39;data1&#39;);
 $Request-&#62;Cookies(&#39;Test&#39;, &#39;data2&#39;);</pre>

<p>Because this is perl, you can (NOT PORTABLE) reference the cookies directly through hash notation. The same 5 commands above could be compressed to:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> $Response-&#62;{Cookies}{Test} = 
        { 
                Secure  =&#62; 1, 
                Value   =&#62;      
                        {
                                data1 =&#62; &#39;test value&#39;, 
                                data2 =&#62; &#39;more test&#39;
                        },
                Expires =&#62; 86400, # not portable, see above
                Domain  =&#62; &#39;host.com&#39;,
                Path    =&#62; &#39;/&#39;
        };</pre>

<p>and the first command would be:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> # you don&#39;t need to use hash notation when you are only setting 
 # a simple value
 $Response-&#62;{Cookies}{&#39;Test Name&#39;} = &#39;Test Value&#39;; </pre>

<p>I prefer the hash notation for cookies, as this looks nice, and is quite perlish. It is here to stay. The Cookie() routine is very complex and does its best to allow access to the underlying hash structure of the data. This is the best emulation I could write trying to match the Collections functionality of cookies in IIS ASP.</p>

<dd>
<p>API Extension. If the Debug config option is set greater than 0, this routine will write @args out to server error log. refs in @args will be expanded one level deep, so data in simple data structures like one-level hash refs and array refs will be displayed. CODE refs like</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> $Response-&#62;Debug(sub { &#34;some value&#34; });</pre>

<p>will be executed and their output added to the debug output. This extension allows the user to tie directly into the debugging capabilities of this module.</p>

<p>While developing an app on a production server, it is often useful to have a separate error log for the application to catch debugging output separately. One way of implementing this is to use the Apache ErrorLog configuration directive to create a separate error log for a virtual host.</p>

<p>If you want further debugging support, like stack traces in your code, consider doing things like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> $Response-&#62;Debug( sub { Carp::longmess(&#39;debug trace&#39;) };
 $SIG{__WARN__} = \&#38;Carp::cluck; # then warn() will stack trace</pre>

<p>The only way at present to see exactly where in your script an error occurred is to set the Debug config directive to 2, and match the error line number to perl script generated from your ASP script.</p>

<p>However, as of version 0.10, the perl script generated from the asp script should match almost exactly line by line, except in cases of inlined includes, which add to the text of the original script, pod comments which are entirely yanked out, and &#60;% # comment %&#62; style comments which have a \n added to them so they still work.</p>

<p>If you would like to see the HTML preceding an error while developing, consider setting the BufferingOn config directive to 0.</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;End()"

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;ErrorDocument($code,_$uri)"

<dd>
<p>API extension that allows for the modification the Apache ErrorDocument at runtime. $uri may be a on site document, off site URL, or string containing the error message.</p>

<p>This extension is useful if you want to have scripts set error codes with $Response-&#62;{Status} like 401 for authentication failure, and to then control from the script what the error message looks like.</p>

<p>For more information on the Apache ErrorDocument mechanism, please see ErrorDocument in the CORE Apache settings, and the Apache-&#62;custom_response() API, for which this method is a wrapper.</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;Include($filename,_@args)"
>$Response-&#62;Include($filename, @args)</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>This API extension calls the routine compiled from asp script in $filename with the args @args. This is a direct translation of the SSI tag</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  &#60;!--#include file=$filename args=@args--&#62;</pre>

<p>Please see the SSI section for more on SSI in general.</p>

<p>This API extension was created to allow greater modularization of code by allowing includes to be called with runtime arguments. Files included are compiled once, and the anonymous code ref from that compilation is cached, thus including a file in this manner is just like calling a perl subroutine. The @args can be found in @_ in the includes like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  # include.inc
  &#60;% my @args = @_; %&#62;</pre>

<p>As of 2.23, multiple return values can be returned from an include like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> my @rv = $Response-&#62;Include($filename, @args);</pre>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;Include(\%cache_args,_@sub_args)_*CACHE_API*"
>$Response-&#62;Include(\%cache_args, @sub_args) *CACHE API*</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>As of version 2.23, output from an include may be cached with this API and the CONFIG settings CacheDir &#38; CacheDB. This can be used to execute expensive includes only rarely where applicable, drastically increasing performance in some cases.</p>

<p>This API extension applies to the entire include family:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  my @rv = $Response-&#62;Include(\%cache_args, @include_args)
  my $html_ref = $Response-&#62;TrapInclude(\%cache_args, @include_args)
  $Server-&#62;Execute(\%cache_args, @include_args)</pre>

<p>For this output cache to work, you must load Apache::ASP in the Apache parent httpd like so:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  # httpd.conf
  PerlModule Apache::ASP</pre>

<p>The cache arguments are shown here</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  $Response-&#62;Include({
    File =&#62; &#39;file.inc&#39;,
    Cache =&#62; 1, # to activate cache layer
    Expires =&#62; 3600, # to expire in one hour
    LastModified =&#62; time() - 600, # to expire if cached before 10 minutes ago
    Key =&#62; $Request-&#62;Form, # to cache based on checksum of serialized form data,
    Clear =&#62; 1, # always executes include &#38; cache output
  }, @include_args);

  File - include file to execute, can be file name or \$script 
    script data passed in as a string reference.

  Cache - activate caching, will run like normal include without this

  Expires - only cache for this long in seconds

  LastModified - if cached before this time(), expire

  Key - The cache item identity.  Can be $data, \$data, \%data, \@data, 
    this data is serialized and combined with the filename &#38; @include_args 
    to create a MD5 checksum to fetch from the cache with. If you wanted
    to cache the results of a search page from form data POSTed, 
    then this key could be 

      { Key =&#62; $Request-&#62;Form }

  Clear - If set to 1, or boolean true, will always execute the include 
    and update the cache entry for it.</pre>

<p>Motivation: If an include takes 1 second to execute because of complex SQL to a database, and you can cache the output of this include because it is not realtime data, and the cache layer runs at .01 seconds, then you have a 100 fold savings on that part of the script. Site scalability can be dramatically increased in this way by intelligently caching bottlenecks in the web application.</p>

<p>Use Sparingly: If you have a fast include, then it may execute faster than the cache layer runs, in which case you may actually slow your site down by using this feature. Therefore try to use this sparingly, and only when sure you really need it. Apache::ASP scripts generally execute very quickly, so most developers will not need to use this feature at all.</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;Include(\$script_text,_@args)"
>$Response-&#62;Include(\$script_text, @args)</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Added in Apache::ASP 2.11, this method allows for executing ASP scripts that are generated dynamically by passing in a reference to the script data instead of the file name. This works just like the normal $Response-&#62;Include() API, except a string reference is passed in instead of a filename. For example:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  &#60;%
    my $script = &#34;&#60;\% print &#39;TEST&#39;; %\&#62;&#34;;
    $Response-&#62;Include(\$script);
  %&#62;</pre>

<p>This include would output TEST. Note that tokens like &#60;% and %&#62; must be escaped so Apache::ASP does not try to compile those code blocks directly when compiling the original script. If the $script data were fetched directly from some external resource like a database, then these tokens would not need to be escaped at all as in:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  &#60;%
    my $script = $dbh-&#62;selectrow_array(
       &#34;select script_text from scripts where script_id = ?&#34;,
       undef, $script_id
       );
    $Response-&#62;Include(\$script);
  %&#62;</pre>

<p>This method could also be used to render other types of dynamic scripts, like XML docs using XMLSubs for example, though for complex runtime XML rendering, one should use something better suited like XSLT. See the $Server-&#62;XSLT API for more on this topic.</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;IsClientConnected()"
>$Response-&#62;IsClientConnected()</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>API Extension. 1 for web client still connected, 0 if disconnected which might happen if the user hits the stop button. The original API for this $Response-&#62;{IsClientConnected} is only updated after a $Response-&#62;Flush is called, so this method may be called for a refreshed status.</p>

<p>Note $Response-&#62;Flush calls $Response-&#62;IsClientConnected to update $Response-&#62;{IsClientConnected} so to use this you are going straight to the source! But if you are doing a loop like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  while(@data) {
    $Response-&#62;End if ! $Response-&#62;{IsClientConnected};
    my $row = shift @data;
    %&#62; &#60;%= $row %&#62; &#60;%
    $Response-&#62;Flush;
  }</pre>

<p>Then its more efficient to use the member instead of the method since $Response-&#62;Flush() has already updated that value for you.</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;Redirect($url)"
>$Response-&#62;Redirect($url)</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Sends the client a command to go to a different url $url. Script immediately ends.</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;TrapInclude($file,_@args)"
>$Response-&#62;TrapInclude($file, @args)</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Calls $Response-&#62;Include() with same arguments as passed to it, but instead traps the include output buffer and returns it as as a perl string reference. This allows one to postprocess the output buffer before sending to the client.</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  my $string_ref = $Response-&#62;TrapInclude(&#39;file.inc&#39;);
  $$string_ref =~ s/\s+/ /sg; # squash whitespace like Clean 1
  print $$string_ref;</pre>

<p>The data is returned as a referenece to save on what might be a large string copy. You may dereference the data with the $$string_ref notation.</p>

<dt><a name='Response'></a><a name="$Response-&#62;Write($data)"
>$Response-&#62;Write($data)</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Write output to the HTML page. &#60;%=$data%&#62; syntax is shorthand for a $Response-&#62;Write($data). All final output to the client must at some point go through this method.</p>
</dd>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="$Request_Object"
>$Request Object</a></h2>

<p>The request object manages the input from the client browser, like posts, query strings, cookies, etc. Normal return results are values if an index is specified, or a collection / perl hash ref if no index is specified. WARNING, the latter property is not supported in ActiveState PerlScript, so if you use the hashes returned by such a technique, it will not be portable.</p>

<p>A normal use of this feature would be to iterate through the form variables in the form hash...</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> $form = $Request-&#62;Form();
 for(keys %{$form}) {
        $Response-&#62;Write(&#34;$_: $form-&#62;{$_}&#60;br&#62;\n&#34;);
 }</pre>

<p>Please see the ./site/eg/server_variables.htm asp file for this method in action.</p>

<p>Note that if a form POST or query string contains duplicate values for a key, those values will be returned through normal use of the $Request object:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  @values = $Request-&#62;Form(&#39;key&#39;);</pre>

<p>but you can also access the internal storage, which is an array reference like so:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  $array_ref = $Request-&#62;{Form}{&#39;key&#39;};
  @values = @{$array_ref};</pre>

<p>Please read the PERLSCRIPT section for more information on how things like $Request-&#62;QueryString() &#38; $Request-&#62;Form() behave as collections.</p>

<dd>
<p>The amount of data sent by the client in the body of the request, usually the length of the form data. This is the same value as $Request-&#62;ServerVariables(&#39;CONTENT_LENGTH&#39;)</p>

<dt><a name='Request'></a><a name="$Request-&#62;BinaryRead([$length])"

<dd>
<p>Returns a string whose contents are the first $length bytes of the form data, or body, sent by the client request. If $length is not given, will return all of the form data. This data is the raw data sent by the client, without any parsing done on it by Apache::ASP.</p>

<p>Note that BinaryRead will not return any data for file uploads. Please see the $Request-&#62;FileUpload() interface for access to this data. $Request-&#62;Form() data will also be available as normal.</p>

>$Request-&#62;Cookies($name [,$key])</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Returns the value of the Cookie with name $name. If a $key is specified, then a lookup will be done on the cookie as if it were a query string. So, a cookie set by:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> Set-Cookie: test=data1=1&#38;data2=2</pre>

<p>would have a value of 2 returned by $Request-&#62;Cookies(&#39;test&#39;,&#39;data2&#39;).</p>

<p>If no name is specified, a hash will be returned of cookie names as keys and cookie values as values. If the cookie value is a query string, it will automatically be parsed, and the value will be a hash reference to these values.</p>

<p>When in doubt, try it out. Remember that unless you set the Expires attribute of a cookie with $Response-&#62;Cookies(&#39;cookie&#39;, &#39;Expires&#39;, $xyz), the cookies that you set will only last until you close your browser, so you may find your self opening &#38; closing your browser a lot when debugging cookies.</p>

<dd>
<p>API extension. The FileUpload interface to file upload data is stabilized. The internal representation of the file uploads is a hash of hashes, one hash per file upload found in the $Request-&#62;Form() collection. This collection of collections may be queried through the normal interface like so:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  $Request-&#62;FileUpload(&#39;upload_file&#39;, &#39;ContentType&#39;);
  $Request-&#62;FileUpload(&#39;upload_file&#39;, &#39;FileHandle&#39;);
  $Request-&#62;FileUpload(&#39;upload_file&#39;, &#39;BrowserFile&#39;);
  $Request-&#62;FileUpload(&#39;upload_file&#39;, &#39;Mime-Header&#39;);
  $Request-&#62;FileUpload(&#39;upload_file&#39;, &#39;TempFile&#39;);

  * note that TempFile must be use with the UploadTempFile 
    configuration setting.</pre>

<p>The above represents the old slow collection interface, but like all collections in Apache::ASP, you can reference the internal hash representation more easily.</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  my $fileup = $Request-&#62;{FileUpload}{upload_file};
  $fileup-&#62;{ContentType};
  $fileup-&#62;{BrowserFile};
  $fileup-&#62;{FileHandle};
  $fileup-&#62;{Mime-Header};
  $fileup-&#62;{TempFile};</pre>

<dt><a name='Request'></a><a name="$Request-&#62;Form($name)"
>$Request-&#62;Form($name)</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Returns the value of the input of name $name used in a form with POST method. If $name is not specified, returns a ref to a hash of all the form data. One can use this hash to create a nice alias to the form data like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> # in global.asa
 use vars qw( $Form );
 sub Script_OnStart {
   $Form = $Request-&#62;Form;
 }
 # then in ASP scripts
 &#60;%= $Form-&#62;{var} %&#62;</pre>

<p>File upload data will be loaded into $Request-&#62;Form(&#39;file_field&#39;), where the value is the actual file name of the file uploaded, and the contents of the file can be found by reading from the file name as a file handle as in:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> while(read($Request-&#62;Form(&#39;file_field_name&#39;), $data, 1024)) {};</pre>

<p>For more information, please see the CGI / File Upload section, as file uploads are implemented via the CGI.pm module. An example can be found in the installation samples ./site/eg/file_upload.asp</p>

<dt><a name='Request'></a><a name="$Request-&#62;ServerVariables($name)"
>$Request-&#62;ServerVariables($name)</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Returns the value of the server variable / environment variable with name $name. If $name is not specified, returns a ref to a hash of all the server / environment variables data. The following would be a common use of this method:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> $env = $Request-&#62;ServerVariables();
 # %{$env} here would be equivalent to the cgi %ENV in perl.</pre>

<p>Like the $Session object, you may use the $Application object to store data across the entire life of the application. Every page in the ASP application always has access to this object.

<p>Be careful not to expose full session ids over the net, as they could be used by a hacker to impersonate another user. So when creating a session manager, for example, you could create some other id to reference the SessionID internally, which would allow you to control the sessions. This kind of application would best be served under a secure web server.</p>

<p>This code demonstrates how one might only try to execute an include if it exists, which is useful since a script will error if it tries to execute an include that does not exist.</p>

<dt><a name='Server'></a><a name="$Server-&#62;MapPath($url);"
>$Server-&#62;MapPath($url);</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Given the url $url, absolute, or relative to the current executing script, this method returns the equivalent filename that the server would translate the request to, regardless or whether the request would be valid.</p>

<p>Only a $url that is relative to the host is valid. Urls like &#34;.&#34; and &#34;/&#34; are fine arguments to MapPath, but <a href="http://localhost" class="podlinkurl"
>http://localhost</a> would not be.</p>

<p>To see this method call in action, check out the sample ./site/eg/server.htm script.</p>

<dt><a name='Server'></a><a name="$Server-&#62;Mail(\%mail,_%smtp_args);"
>$Server-&#62;Mail(\%mail, %smtp_args);</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>With the Net::SMTP and Net::Config modules installed, which are part of the perl libnet package, you may use this API extension to send email. The \%mail hash reference that you pass in must have values for at least the To, From, and Subject headers, and the Body of the mail message.</p>

<p>The return value of this routine is 1 for success, 0 for failure. If the MailHost SMTP server is not available, this will have a return value of 0.</p>

<p>You could send an email like so:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> $Server-&#62;Mail({
                To =&#62; &#39;somebody@yourdomain.com.foobar&#39;,
                From =&#62; &#39;youremail@yourdomain.com.foobar&#39;,
                Subject =&#62; &#39;Subject of Email&#39;,
                Body =&#62; 
                 &#39;Body of message. &#39;.
                 &#39;You might have a lot to say here!&#39;,
                Organization =&#62; &#39;Your Organization&#39;,
                CC =&#62; &#39;youremailcc@yourdomain.com.foobar&#39;,
                BCC =&#62; &#39;youremailbcc@yourdomain.com.foobar&#39;,
                Debug =&#62; 0 || 1,
               });</pre>

<p>Any extra fields specified for the email will be interpreted as headers for the email, so to send an HTML email, you could set &#39;Content-Type&#39; =&#62; &#39;text/html&#39; in the above example.</p>

<p>If you have MailFrom configured, this will be the default for the From header in your email. For more configuration options like the MailHost setting, check out the CONFIG section.</p>

<p>The return value of this method call will be boolean for success of the mail being sent.</p>

<p>If you would like to specially configure the Net::SMTP object used internally, you may set %smtp_args and they will be passed on when that object is initialized. &#34;perldoc Net::SMTP&#34; for more into on this topic.</p>

<p>If you would like to include the output of an ASP page as the body of the mail message, you might do something like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  my $mail_body = $Response-&#62;TrapInclude(&#39;mail_body.inc&#39;);
  $Server-&#62;Mail({ %mail, Body =&#62; $$mail_body });</pre>

<dt><a name='Server'></a><a name="$Server-&#62;RegisterCleanup($sub)"
>$Server-&#62;RegisterCleanup($sub)</a></dt>

<dd>
<pre class="sh_perl"> non-portable extension</pre>

<p>Sets a subroutine reference to be executed after the script ends, whether normally or abnormally, the latter occurring possibly by the user hitting the STOP button, or the web server being killed. This subroutine must be a code reference created like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> $Server-&#62;RegisterCleanup(sub { $main::Session-&#62;{served}++; });
   or
 sub served { $main::Session-&#62;{served}++; }
 $Server-&#62;RegisterCleanup(\&#38;served);</pre>

<p>The reference to the subroutine passed in will be executed. Though the subroutine will be executed in anonymous context, instead of the script, all objects will still be defined in main::*, that you would reference normally in your script. Output written to $main::Response will have no affect at this stage, as the request to the www client has already completed.</p>

<p>Check out the ./site/eg/register_cleanup.asp script for an example of this routine in action.</p>

<dt><a name='Server'></a><a name="$Server-&#62;Transfer($file,_@args)"
>$Server-&#62;Transfer($file, @args)</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>New method from ASP 3.0. Transfers control to another script. The Response buffer will not be cleared automatically, so if you want this to serve as a faster $Response-&#62;Redirect(), you will need to call $Response-&#62;Clear() before calling this method.</p>

<p>This new script will take over current execution and the current script will not continue to be executed afterwards. It differs from Execute() because the original script will not pick up where it left off.</p>

<p>As of Apache::ASP 2.31, this method now accepts optional arguments like $Response-&#62;Include &#38; $Server-&#62;Execute. $Server-&#62;Transfer is now just a wrapper for:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  $Response-&#62;Include($file, @args);
  $Response-&#62;End;</pre>

<dt><a name='Server'></a><a name="$Server-&#62;URLEncode($string)"
>$Server-&#62;URLEncode($string)</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Returns the URL-escaped version of the string $string. +&#39;s are substituted in for spaces and special characters are escaped to the ascii equivalents. Strings encoded in this manner are safe to put in urls... they are especially useful for encoding data used in a query string as in:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> $data = $Server-&#62;URLEncode(&#34;test data&#34;);
 $url = &#34;<a href="http://localhost?data=$data" class="podlinkurl"
>http://localhost?data=$data</a>&#34;;

 $url evaluates to <a href="http://localhost?data=test+data" class="podlinkurl"
>http://localhost?data=test+data</a>, and is a 
 valid URL for use in anchor &#60;a&#62; tags and redirects, etc.</pre>

<dt><a name='Server'></a><a name="$Server-&#62;URL($url,_\%params)"
>$Server-&#62;URL($url, \%params)</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Will return a URL with %params serialized into a query string like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  $url = $Server-&#62;URL(&#39;test.asp&#39;, { test =&#62; value });</pre>

<p>which would give you a URL of test.asp?test=value</p>

<p>Used in conjunction with the SessionQuery* settings, the returned URL will also have the session id inserted into the query string, making this a critical part of that method of implementing cookieless sessions. For more information on that topic please read on the setting in the CONFIG section, and the SESSIONS section too.</p>

<dt><a name='Server'></a><a name="$Server-&#62;XSLT(\$xsl_data,_\$xml_data)"
>$Server-&#62;XSLT(\$xsl_data, \$xml_data)</a></dt>

<dd>
<pre class="sh_perl"> * NON-PORTABLE API EXTENSION *</pre>

<p>This method takes string references for XSL and XML data and returns the XSLT output as a string reference like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  my $xslt_data_ref = $Server-&#62;XSLT(\$xsl_data, \$xml_data)
  print $$xslt_data_ref;</pre>

<p>The XSLT parser defaults to XML::XSLT, and is configured with the XSLTParser setting, which can also use XML::Sablotron ( support added in 2.11 ), and XML::LibXSLT ( support added in 2.29 ). Please see the CONFIG section for more information on the XSLT* settings that drive this API. The XSLT setting itself uses this API internally to do its rendering.</p>

<p>This API was created to allow developers easy XSLT component rendering without having to render the entire ASP scripts via XSLT. This will make an easy plugin architecture for those looking to integrate XML into their existing ASP application frameworks.</p>

<p>At some point, the API will likely take files as arguments, but not as of the 2.11 release.</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="SSI"
>SSI <img alt='^' src='http://st.pimg.net/tucs/img/up.gif'></a></h1>

<p>SSI is great! One of the main features of server side includes is to include other files in the script being requested. In Apache::ASP, this is implemented in a couple ways, the most crucial of which is implemented in the file include. Formatted as</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> &#60;!--#include file=filename.inc--&#62;</pre>

<p>,the .inc being merely a convention, text from the included file will be inserted directly into the script being executed and the script will be compiled as a whole. Whenever the script or any of its includes change, the script will be recompiled.</p>

<p>Includes go a great length to promote good decomposition and code sharing in ASP scripts, but they are still fairly static. As of version .09, includes may have dynamic runtime execution, as subroutines compiled into the global.asa namespace. The first way to invoke includes dynamically is</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> &#60;!--#include file=filename.inc args=@args--&#62;</pre>

<p>If @args is specified, Apache::ASP knows to execute the include at runtime instead of inlining it directly into the compiled code of the script. It does this by compiling the script at runtime as a subroutine, and caching it for future invocations. Then the compiled subroutine is executed and has @args passed into its as arguments.</p>

<p>This is still might be too static for some, as @args is still hardcoded into the ASP script, so finally, one may execute an include at runtime by utilizing this API extension</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">   $Response-&#62;Include(&#34;filename.inc&#34;, @args);</pre>

<p>which is a direct translation of the dynamic include above.</p>

<p>Although inline includes should be a little faster, runtime dynamic includes represent great potential savings in httpd memory, as includes are shared between scripts keeping the size of each script to a minimum. This can often be significant saving if much of the formatting occurs in an included header of a www page.</p>

<p>By default, all includes will be inlined unless called with an args parameter. However, if you want all your includes to be compiled as subs and dynamically executed at runtime, turn the DynamicIncludes config option on as documented above.</p>

<p>That is not all! SSI is full featured. One of the things missing above is the</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> &#60;!--#include virtual=filename.cgi--&#62;</pre>

<p>tag. This and many other SSI code extensions are available by filtering Apache::ASP output through Apache::SSI via the Apache::Filter and the Filter config options. For more information on how to wire Apache::ASP and Apache::SSI together, please see the Filter config option documented above. Also please see Apache::SSI for further information on the capabilities it offers.</p>

<p>Use with Apache. Copy the ./site/eg directory from the ASP installation to your Apache document tree and try it out! You have to put &#34;AllowOverride All&#34; in your &#60;Directory&#62; config section to let the .htaccess file in the ./site/eg installation directory do its work.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT (FAQ): Make sure that the web server has write access to that directory. Usually a</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="SESSIONS"
>SESSIONS <img alt='^' src='http://st.pimg.net/tucs/img/up.gif'></a></h1>

<p>Cookies are used by default for user $Session support ( see OBJECTS ). In order to track a web user and associate server side data with that client, the web server sets, and the web client returns a 32 byte session id identifier cookie. This implementation is very secure and may be used in secure HTTPS transactions, and made stronger with SecureSession and ParanoidSession settings (see CONFIG ).</p>

<p>However good cookies are for this kind of persistent state management between HTTP requests, they have long been under fire for security risks associated with JavaScript security exploits and privacy abuse by large data tracking companies.</p>

<p>Because of these reasons, web users will sometimes turn off their cookies, rendering normal ASP session implementations powerless, resulting in a new $Session generated every request. This is not good for ASP style sessions.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Cookieless_Sessions"
>Cookieless Sessions</a></h2>

<pre class="sh_perl"> *** See WARNING Below ***</pre>

<p>So we now have more ways to track sessions with the SessionQuery* CONFIG settings, that allow a web developer to embed the session id in URL query strings when use of cookies is denied. The implementations work such that if a user has cookies turned on, then cookies will be used, but for those users with cookies turned off, the session ids will be parsed into document URLs.</p>

<p>The first and easiest method that a web developer may use to implement cookieless sessions are with SessionQueryParse* directives which enable Apache::ASP to the parse the session id into document URLs on the fly. Because this is resource inefficient, there is also the SessionQuery* directives that may be used with the $Server-&#62;URL($url,\%params) method to generate custom URLs with the session id in its query string.</p>

<p>To see an example of these cookieless sessions in action, check out the ./site/eg/session_query_parse.asp example.</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> *** WARNING ***</pre>

<p>If you do use these methods, then be VERY CAREFUL of linking offsite from a page that was accessed with a session id in a query string. This is because this session id will show up in the HTTP_REFERER logs of the linked to site, and a malicious hacker could use this information to compromise the security of your site&#39;s $Sessions, even if these are run under a secure web server.</p>

<p>In order to shake a session id off an HTTP_REFERER for a link taking a user offsite, you must point that link to a redirect page that will redirect a user, like so:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> &#60;% 
    # &#34;cross site scripting bug&#34; prevention
    my $sanitized_url = 
        $Server-&#62;HTMLEncode($Response-&#62;QueryString(&#39;OffSiteUrl&#39;));
 %&#62;
 &#60;html&#62;
 &#60;head&#62;
 &#60;meta http-equiv=refresh content=&#39;0;URL=&#60;%=$sanitized_url%&#62;&#39;&#62;
 &#60;/head&#62;
 &#60;body&#62; 
        Redirecting you offsite to 
        &#60;a href=&#60;%=$sanitized_url%&#62; &#62;here&#60;/a&#62;...
 &#60;/body&#62;
 &#60;/html&#62;</pre>

<p>Because the web browser visits a real page before being redirected with the &#60;meta&#62; tag, the HTTP_REFERER will be set to this page. Just be sure to not link to this page with a session id in its query string.</p>

<p>Unfortunately a simple $Response-&#62;Redirect() will not work here, because the web browser will keep the HTTP_REFERER of the original web page if only a normal redirect is used.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Custom_Tags_with_XMLSubsMatch"
>Custom Tags with XMLSubsMatch</a></h2>

<p>Before XML, there was the need to make HTML markup smarter. Apache::ASP gives you the ability to have a perl subroutine handle the execution of any predefined tag, taking the tag descriptors, and the text contained between, as arguments of the subroutine. This custom tag technology can be used to extend a web developer&#39;s abilities to add dynamic pieces without having to visibly use &#60;% %&#62; style code entries.</p>

<p>So, lets say that you have a table that you want to insert for an employee with contact info and the like, you could set up a tag like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> &#60;my:new-employee name=&#34;Jane&#34; last=&#34;Doe&#34; phone=&#34;555-2222&#34;&#62;
   Jane Doe has been here since 1998.
 &#60;/my:new-employee&#62;</pre>

<p>To render it with a custom tag, you would tell the Apache::ASP parser to render the tag with a subroutine:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  PerlSetVar XMLSubsMatch my:new-employee</pre>

<p>Any colons, &#39;:&#39;, in the XML custom tag will turn into &#39;::&#39;, a perl package separator, so the my:employee tag would translate to the my::employee subroutine, or the employee subroutine in the my package. Any dash &#34;-&#34; will also be translated to an underscore &#34;_&#34;, as dash is not valid in the names of perl subroutines.</p>

<p>Then you would create the my::employee subroutine in the my perl package or whereever like so:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  package my;
  sub new_employee {
    my($attributes, $body) = @_;
    $main::Response-&#62;Include(&#39;new_employee.inc&#39;, $attributes, $body);
  }
  1;

  &#60;!-- # new_employee.inc file somewhere else, maybe in Global directory --&#62;
  &#60;% my($attributes, $body) = @_; %&#62;
  &#60;table&#62;
  &#60;% for(&#39;name&#39;, &#39;last&#39;, &#39;phone&#39;) { %&#62;
    &#60;tr&#62;
      &#60;td&#62;&#60;b&#62;&#60;%=ucfirst $_ %&#62;&#60;/b&#62;:&#60;/td&#62;
      &#60;td&#62;&#60;%= $attributes-&#62;{$_} %&#62;&#60;/td&#62;
    &#60;/tr&#62;
  &#60;% } %&#62;
  &#60;tr&#62;&#60;td colspan=2&#62;&#60;%= $body %&#62;&#60;/td&#62;&#60;/tr&#62;
  &#60;/table&#62;
  &#60;!-- # end new_employee.inc file --&#62;</pre>

<p>The $main::Response-&#62;Include() would then delegate the rendering of the new-employee to the new_employee.inc ASP script include.</p>

<p>Though XML purists would not like this custom tag technology to be related to XML, the reality is that a careful site engineer could render full XML documents with this technology, applying all the correct styles that one might otherwise do with XSLT.</p>

<p>Custom tags defined in this way can be used as XML tags are defined with both a body and without as it</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  &#60;my:new-employee&#62;...&#60;/my:new-employee&#62;</pre>

<p>and just</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  &#60;my:new-employee /&#62;</pre>

<p>These tags are very powerful in that they can also enclose normal ASP logic, like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  &#60;my:new-employee&#62;
    &#60;!-- normal ASP logic --&#62;
    &#60;% my $birthday = &#38;HTTP::Date::time2str(time - 25 * 86400 * 365); %&#62;

    &#60;!-- ASP inserts --&#62;
    This employee has been online for &#60;%= int(rand()*600)+1 %&#62;
    seconds, and was born near &#60;%= $birthday %&#62;.
  &#60;/my:new-employee&#62;   </pre>

<p>For an example of this custom XML tagging in action, please check out the ./site/eg/xml_subs.asp script.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="XSLT_Tranformations"
>XSLT Tranformations</a></h2>

<p>XML is good stuff, but what can you use it for? The principle is that by having data and style separated in XML and XSL files, you can reformat your data more easily in the future, and you can render your data in multiple formats, just as easily as for your web site, so you might render your site to a PDA, or a cell phone just as easily as to a browser, and all you have to do is set up the right XSL stylesheets to do the transformation (XSLT).</p>

<p>With native XML/XSLT support, Apache::ASP scripts may be the source of XML data that the XSL file transforms, and the XSL file itself will be first executed as an ASP script also. The XSLT transformation is handled by XML::XSLT or XML::Sablotron and you can see an example of it in action at the ./site/eg/xslt.xml XML script.</p>

<p>To specify a XSL stylesheet, use the setting:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  PerlSetVar XSLT template.xsl</pre>

<p>where template.xsl could be any file. By default this will XSLT transform all ASP scripts so configured, but you can separate xml scripts from the rest with the setting:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  PerlSetVar XSLTMatch xml$</pre>

<p>where all files with the ending xml would undergo a XSLT transformation.</p>

<p>Note that XSLT depends on the installation of XML::XSLT, which in turn depends on XML::DOM, and XML::Parser. As of version 2.11, XML::Sablotron may also be used by setting:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  PerlSetVar XSLTParser XML::Sablotron</pre>

<p>and XML::LibXSLT may be used, as of 2.29, by setting</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  PerlSetVar XSLTParser XML::LibXSLT</pre>

<p>If you would like to install XML::Sablotron or XML::LibXSLT, you will first have to install the libraries that these perl modules use, which you can get at:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  libxslt - The XSLT C Library for Gnome
  <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/" class="podlinkurl"
>http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/</a>

  Sablotron - Ginger Alliance

<p>XML:XSLT was the first supported XSLT engine as has the benefit of being written in pure perl so that though while it is slower than the other solutions, it is easier to port.</p>

<p>If you would like to cache XSLT tranformations, which is highly recommended, just set:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  PerlSetVar XSLTCache 1</pre>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="CGI"
>CGI <img alt='^' src='http://st.pimg.net/tucs/img/up.gif'></a></h1>

<p>CGI has been the standard way of deploying web applications long before ASP came along. In the CGI gateway world, CGI.pm has been a widely used module in building CGI applications, and Apache::ASP is compatible with scripts written with CGI.pm. Also, as of version 2.19, Apache::ASP can run in standalone CGI mode for the Apache web server without mod_perl being available. See &#34;Standalone CGI Mode&#34; section below.</p>

<p>Following are some special notes with respect to compatibility with CGI and CGI.pm. Use of CGI.pm in any of these ways was made possible through a great amount of work, and is not guaranteed to be portable with other perl ASP implementations, as other ASP implementations will likely be more limited.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name='Standalone'></a><a name="Standalone_CGI_Mode,_without_mod_perl"
>Standalone CGI Mode, without mod_perl</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>As of version 2.19, Apache::ASP scripts may be run as standalone CGI scripts without mod_perl being loaded into Apache. Work to date has only been done with mod_cgi scripts under Apache on a Unix platform, and it is unlikely to work under other web servers or Win32 operating systems without further development.</p>

<p>To run the ./site/eg scripts as CGI scripts, you copy the ./site directory to some location accessible by your web server, in this example its /usr/local/apache/htdocs/aspcgi, then in your httpd.conf activate Apache::ASP cgi scripts like so:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> Alias /aspcgi/ /usr/local/apache/htdocs/aspcgi/
 &#60;Directory /usr/local/apache/htdocs/aspcgi/eg/ &#62;
   AddType application/x-httpd-cgi .htm
   AddType application/x-httpd-cgi .html
   AddType application/x-httpd-cgi .asp
   AddType application/x-httpd-cgi .xml
   AddType application/x-httpd-cgi .ssi
   AllowOverride None
   Options +ExecCGI +Indexes
 &#60;/Directory&#62;</pre>

<p>Then install the asp-perl script from the distribution into /usr/bin, or some other directory. This is so the CGI execution line at the top of those scripts will invoke the asp-perl wrapper like so:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> #!/usr/bin/perl /usr/bin/asp-perl</pre>

<p>The asp-perl script is a cgi wrapper that sets up the Apache::ASP environment in lieu of the normal mod_perl handler request. Because there is no Apache-&#62;dir_config() data available under mod_cgi, the asp-perl script will load a asp.conf file that may define a hash %Config of data for populating the dir_config() data. An example of a complex asp.conf file is at ./site/eg/asp.conf</p>

<p>So, a trivial asp.conf file might look like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> # asp.conf
 %Config = (
   &#39;Global&#39; =&#62; &#39;.&#39;,
   &#39;StateDir&#39; =&#62; &#39;/tmp/aspstate&#39;,
   &#39;NoState&#39; =&#62; 0,
   &#39;Debug&#39; =&#62; 3,
 );</pre>

<p>The default for NoState is 1 in CGI mode, so one must set NoState to 0 for objects like $Session &#38; $Application to be defined.</p>

<dt><a name='CGI'></a><a name="CGI.pm"
>CGI.pm</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>CGI.pm is a very useful module that aids developers in the building of these applications, and Apache::ASP has been made to be compatible with function calls in CGI.pm. Please see cgi.htm in the ./site/eg directory for a sample ASP script written almost entirely in CGI.</p>

<p>As of version 0.09, use of CGI.pm for both input and output is seamless when working under Apache::ASP. Thus if you would like to port existing cgi scripts over to Apache::ASP, all you need to do is wrap &#60;% %&#62; around the script to get going. This functionality has been implemented so that developers may have the best of both worlds when building their web applications.</p>

<p>For more information about CGI.pm, please see the web site</p>

<dd>
<p>You may create a CGI.pm $query object like so:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">        use CGI;
        my $query = new CGI;</pre>

<p>As of Apache::ASP version 0.09, form input may be read in by CGI.pm upon initialization. Before, Apache::ASP would consume the form input when reading into $Request-&#62;Form(), but now form input is cached, and may be used by CGI.pm input routines.</p>

<dt><a name='CGI'></a><a name="CGI_headers"
>CGI headers</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Not only can you use the CGI.pm $query-&#62;header() method to put out headers, but with the CgiHeaders config option set to true, you can also print &#34;Header: value\n&#34;, and add similar lines to the top of your script, like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> Some-Header: Value
 Some-Other: OtherValue

 &#60;html&#62;&#60;body&#62; Script body starts here.</pre>

<p>Once there are no longer any cgi style headers, or the there is a newline, the body of the script begins. So if you just had an asp script like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">    print join(&#34;:&#34;, %{$Request-&#62;QueryString});</pre>

<p>You would likely end up with no output, as that line is interpreted as a header because of the semicolon. When doing basic debugging, as long as you start the page with &#60;html&#62; you will avoid this problem.</p>

<dt><a name='print'></a><a name="print()ing_CGI"
>print()ing CGI</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>CGI is notorious for its print() statements, and the functions in CGI.pm usually return strings to print(). You can do this under Apache::ASP, since print just aliases to $Response-&#62;Write(). Note that $| has no affect.</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">        print $query-&#62;header();
        print $query-&#62;start_form();</pre>

<dt><a name='File'></a><a name="File_Upload"
>File Upload</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>CGI.pm is used for implementing reading the input from file upload. You may create the file upload form however you wish, and then the data may be recovered from the file upload by using $Request-&#62;Form(). Data from a file upload gets written to a file handle, that may in turn be read from. The original file name that was uploaded is the name of the file handle.</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">        my $filehandle = $Request-&#62;Form(&#39;file_upload_field_name&#39;);
        print $filehandle; # will get you the file name
        my $data;
        while(read($filehandle, $data, 1024)) {
                # data from the uploaded file read into $data
        };</pre>

<p>Please see the docs on CGI.pm (try perldoc CGI) for more information on this topic, and ./site/eg/file_upload.asp for an example of its use. Also, for more details about CGI.pm itself, please see the web site:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">    <a href="http://stein.cshl.org/WWW/software/CGI/" class="podlinkurl"
>http://stein.cshl.org/WWW/software/CGI/</a></pre>

<p>Occasionally, a newer version of CGI.pm will be released which breaks file upload compatibility with Apache::ASP. If you find this to occur, then you might consider downgrading to a version that works. For example, one can install a working CGI.pm v2.78 for a working version, and to get old versions of this module, one can go to BACKPAN at:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">    <a href="http://backpan.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/L/LD/LDS/" class="podlinkurl"
>http://backpan.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/L/LD/LDS/</a></pre>

<p>There is also $Request-&#62;FileUpload() API extension that you can use to get more data about a file upload, so that the following properties are available for querying:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  my $file_upload = $Request-&#62;{FileUpload}{upload_field};
  $file_upload-&#62;{BrowserFile}
  $file_upload-&#62;{FileHandle}
  $file_upload-&#62;{ContentType}

  # only if FileUploadTemp is set
  $file_upload-&#62;{TempFile}      

  # whatever mime headers are sent with the file upload
  # just &#34;keys %$file_upload&#34; to find out
  $file_upload-&#62;{?Mime-Header?}</pre>

<p>Please see the $Request section in OBJECTS for more information.</p>

name="PERLSCRIPT"
>PERLSCRIPT <img alt='^' src='http://st.pimg.net/tucs/img/up.gif'></a></h1>

<p>Much work has been done to bring compatibility with ASP applications written in PerlScript under IIS. Most of that work revolved around bringing a Win32::OLE Collection interface to many of the objects in Apache::ASP, which are natively written as perl hashes.</p>

<p>New as of version 2.05 is new functionality enabled with the CollectionItem setting, to giver better support to more recent PerlScript syntax. This seems helpful when porting from an IIS/PerlScript code base. Please see the CONFIG section for more info.</p>

<p>The following objects in Apache::ASP respond as Collections:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">        $Application
        $Session
        $Request-&#62;FileUpload *
        $Request-&#62;FileUpload(&#39;upload_file&#39;) *
        $Request-&#62;Form
        $Request-&#62;QueryString
        $Request-&#62;Cookies
        $Response-&#62;Cookies
        $Response-&#62;Cookies(&#39;some_cookie&#39;)       

  * FileUpload API Extensions</pre>

<p>And as such may be used with the following syntax, as compared with the Apache::ASP native calls. Please note the native Apache::ASP interface is compatible with the deprecated PerlScript interface.</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> C = PerlScript Compatibility   N = Native Apache::ASP 
  
 ## Collection-&#62;Contents($name) 
 [C] $Application-&#62;Contents(&#39;XYZ&#39;)              
 [N] $Application-&#62;{XYZ}

 ## Collection-&#62;SetProperty($property, $name, $value)
 [C] $Application-&#62;Contents-&#62;SetProperty(&#39;Item&#39;, &#39;XYZ&#39;, &#34;Fred&#34;);
 [N] $Application-&#62;{XYZ} = &#34;Fred&#34;
        
 ## Collection-&#62;GetProperty($property, $name)

 [N] print $Request-&#62;{QueryString}{&#39;message&#39;}, &#34;&#60;br&#62;\n\n&#34;;              

 ## Working with Cookies
 [C] $Response-&#62;SetProperty(&#39;Cookies&#39;, &#39;Testing&#39;, &#39;Extra&#39;);
 [C] $Response-&#62;SetProperty(&#39;Cookies&#39;, &#39;Testing&#39;, {&#39;Path&#39; =&#62; &#39;/&#39;});

 [N] print $Request-&#62;{Cookies}{Testing} . &#34;&#60;br&#62;\n&#34;;</pre>

<p>Several incompatibilities exist between PerlScript and Apache::ASP:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> &#62; Collection-&#62;{Count} property has not been implemented.
 &#62; VBScript dates may not be used for Expires property of cookies.

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="STYLE_GUIDE"
>STYLE GUIDE <img alt='^' src='http://st.pimg.net/tucs/img/up.gif'></a></h1>

<p>Here are some general style guidelines. Treat these as tips for best practices on Apache::ASP development if you will.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="UseStrict"
>UseStrict</a></h2>

<p>One of perl&#39;s blessings is also its bane, variables do not need to be declared, and are by default globally scoped. The problem with this in mod_perl is that global variables persist from one request to another even if a different web browser is viewing a page.</p>

<p>To avoid this problem, perl programmers have often been advised to add to the top of their perl scripts:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  use strict;</pre>

<p>In Apache::ASP, you can do this better by setting:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  PerlSetVar UseStrict 1</pre>

<p>which will cover both script &#38; global.asa compilation and will catch &#34;use strict&#34; errors correctly. For perl modules, please continue to add &#34;use strict&#34; to the top of them.</p>

<p>Because its so essential in catching hard to find errors, this configuration will likely become the default in some future release. For now, keep setting it.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Do_not_define_subroutines_in_scripts."
>Do not define subroutines in scripts.</a></h2>

<p>DO NOT add subroutine declarations in scripts. Apache::ASP is optimized by compiling a script into a subroutine for faster future invocation. Adding a subroutine definition to a script then looks like this to the compiler:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  sub page_script_sub {
    ...
    ... some HTML ...
    ...
    sub your_sub {
      ...
    }
    ...
  }</pre>

<p>The biggest problem with subroutines defined in subroutines is the side effect of creating closures, which will not behave as usually desired in a mod_perl environment. To understand more about closures, please read up on them &#38; &#34;Nested Subroutines&#34; at:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  <a href="http://perl.apache.org/docs/general/perl_reference/perl_reference.html" class="podlinkurl"
>http://perl.apache.org/docs/general/perl_reference/perl_reference.html</a></pre>

<p>Instead of defining subroutines in scripts, you may add them to your sites global.asa, or you may create a perl package or module to share with your scripts. For more on perl objects &#38; modules, please see:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/perlobj.html" class="podlinkurl"
>http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/perlobj.html</a></pre>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Use_global.asa&#39;s_Script_On*_Events"
>Use global.asa&#39;s Script_On* Events</a></h2>

<p>Chances are that you will find yourself doing the same thing repeatedly in each of your web application&#39;s scripts. You can use Script_OnStart and Script_OnEnd to automate these routine tasks. These events are called before and after each script request.</p>

<p>For example, let&#39;s say you have a header &#38; footer you would like to include in the output of every page, then you might:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> # global.asa
 sub Script_OnStart {
   $Response-&#62;Include(&#39;header.inc&#39;);
 }
 sub Script_OnEnd {
   $Response-&#62;Include(&#39;footer.inc&#39;);
 }</pre>

<p>Or let&#39;s say you want to initialize a global database connection for use in your scripts:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> # global.asa
 use Apache::DBI;   # automatic persistent database connections
 use DBI;

 use vars qw($dbh); # declare global $dbh

 sub Script_OnStart {
   # initialize $dbh
   $dbh = DBI-&#62;connect(...);

   # force you to explicitly commit when you want to save data
   $Server-&#62;RegisterCleanup(sub { $dbh-&#62;rollback; });
 }

 sub Script_OnEnd {
   # not really necessary when using persistent connections, but
   # will free this one object reference at least
   $dbh = undef;
 }</pre>

<dt><a name='Why'></a><a name="Why_do_variables_retain_their_values_between_requests?"
>Why do variables retain their values between requests?</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Unless scoped by my() or local(), perl variables in mod_perl are treated as globals, and values set may persist from one request to another. This can be seen in as simple a script as this:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  &#60;HTML&#62;&#60;BODY&#62;
    $counter++;
    $Response-&#62;Write(&#34;&#60;BR&#62;Counter: $counter&#34;);
  &#60;/BODY&#62;&#60;/HTML&#62;</pre>

<p>The value for $counter++ will remain between requests. Generally use of globals in this way is a BAD IDEA, and you can spare yourself many headaches if do &#34;use strict&#34; perl programming which forces you to explicity declare globals like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  use vars qw($counter);</pre>

<p>You can make all your Apache::ASP scripts strict by default by setting:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  PerlSetVar UseStrict 1</pre>

<dt><a name='Apache'></a><a name="Apache_errors_on_the_PerlHandler_or_PerlModule_directives_?"
>Apache errors on the PerlHandler or PerlModule directives ?</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>You get an error message like this:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> Invalid command &#39;PerlModule&#39;, perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a 
 module not included in the server configuration.</pre>

<p>You do not have mod_perl correctly installed for Apache. The PerlHandler and PerlModule directives in Apache *.conf files are extensions enabled by mod_perl and will not work if mod_perl is not correctly installed.</p>

<p>Common user errors are not doing a &#39;make install&#39; for mod_perl, which installs the perl side of mod_perl, and not starting the right httpd after building it. The latter often occurs when you have an old apache server without mod_perl, and you have built a new one without copying over to its proper location.</p>

<dd>
<p>Very carefully. Please read the $Session documentation in the OBJECTS section. You can store very complex objects in $Session, but you have to understand the limits, and the syntax that must be used to make this happen.</p>

<p>In particular, stay away from statements that that have more than one level of indirection on the left side of an assignment like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  $Session-&#62;{complex}{object} = $data;</pre>

<dt><a name='How'></a><a name="How_can_I_keep_search_engine_spiders_from_killing_the_session_manager?"
>How can I keep search engine spiders from killing the session manager?</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>If you want to disallow session creation for certain non web browser user agents, like search engine spiders, you can use a mod_perl PerlInitHandler like this to set configuration variables at runtime:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> # put the following code into httpd.conf and stop/start apache server
 PerlInitHandler My::InitHandler

 &#60;Perl&#62;

  package My::InitHandler;
  use Apache;

  sub handler {
    my $r = shift; # get the Apache request object

    # if not a Mozilla User Agent, then disable sessions explicitly
    unless($r-&#62;headers_in(&#39;User-Agent&#39;) =~ /^Mozilla/) {
       $r-&#62;dir_config(&#39;AllowSessionState&#39;, &#39;Off&#39;);
    }

    return 200; # return OK mod_perl status code
  }

  1;

 &#60;/Perl&#62;</pre>

<p>This will configure your environment before Apache::ASP executes and sees the configuration settings. You can use the mod_perl API in this way to configure Apache::ASP at runtime.</p>

<p>Note that the Session Manager is very robust on its own, and denial of service attacks of the types that spiders and other web bots normally execute are not likely to affect the Session Manager significantly.</p>

<dt><a name='How'></a><a name="How_can_I_use_$Session_to_store_a_$dbh_database_handle_?"

<dd>
<p>You cannot use $Session to store a $dbh handle. This can be awkward for those coming from the IIS/NT world, where you could store just about anything in $Session, but this boils down to a difference between threads vs. processes.</p>

<p>Database handles often have per process file handles open, which cannot be shared between requests, so though you have stored the $dbh data in $Session, all the other initializations are not relevant in another httpd process.</p>

<p>All is not lost! Apache::DBI can be used to cache database connections on a per process basis, and will work for most cases.</p>

<p>Yes, but not with this Perl module. For ASP with other scripting languages besides Perl, you will need to go with a commercial vendor in the UNIX world. Sun has such a solution. Of course on Windows NT and Windows 2000, you get VBScript for free with IIS.</p>

<dt><a name='How'></a><a name="How_are_file_uploads_handled?"

<dd>
<p>Please see the CGI section. File uploads are implemented through CGI.pm which is loaded at runtime only for this purpose. This is the only time that CGI.pm will be loaded by Apache::ASP, which implements all other cgi-ish functionality natively. The rationale for not implementing file uploads natively is that the extra 100K in memory for CGI.pm shouldn&#39;t be a big deal if you are working with bulky file uploads.</p>

<dt><a name='How'></a><a name="How_do_I_access_the_ASP_Objects_in_general?"

<p>This notation can be used from anywhere in perl, including routines registered with $Server-&#62;RegisterCleanup().</p>

<p>You use the normal notation in your scripts, includes, and global.asa:</p>

<p>Written in late 1999 this article provides an early look at how to tune your Apache::ASP web site. It has since been updated to remain current with Apache::ASP v2.29+</p>

<pre class="sh_perl">  Apache::ASP Site Tuning
  <a href="http://www.chamas.com/asp/articles/perlmonth3_tune.html" class="podlinkurl"

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Tuning_&#38;_Benchmarking"
>Tuning &#38; Benchmarking</a></h2>

<p>When performance tuning, it is important to have a tool to measure the impact of your tuning change by change. The program ab, or Apache Bench, provides this functionality well, and is freely included in the apache distribution.</p>

<p>Because performance tuning can be a neverending affair, it is a good idea to establish a threshold where performance is &#34;good enough&#34;, that once reached, tuning stops.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="$Application_&#38;_$Session_State"
>$Application &#38; $Session State</a></h2>

<p>Use NoState 1 setting if you don&#39;t need the $Application or $Session objects. State objects such as these tie to files on disk and will incur a performance penalty.</p>

<p>If you need the state objects $Application and $Session, and if running an OS that caches files in memory, set your &#34;StateDir&#34; directory to a cached file system. On WinNT, all files may be cached, and you have no control of this. On Solaris, /tmp is a RAM disk and would be a good place to set the &#34;StateDir&#34; config setting to. When cached file systems are used there is little performance penalty for using state files. Linux tends to do a good job caching its file systems, so pick a StateDir for ease of system administration.</p>

<p>On Win32 systems, where mod_perl requests are serialized, you can freely use SessionSerialize to make your $Session requests faster, and you can achieve similar performance benefits for $Application if you call $Application-&#62;Lock() in your global.asa&#39;s Script_OnStart.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Low_MaxClients"
>Low MaxClients</a></h2>

<p>Set your MaxClients low, such that if you have that many httpd servers running, which will happen on busy site, your system will not start swapping to disk because of excessive RAM usage. Typical settings are less than 100 even with 1 gig RAM! To handle more client connections, look into a dual server, mod_proxy front end.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="High_MaxRequestsPerChild"
>High MaxRequestsPerChild</a></h2>

<p>Set your max requests per child thread or process (in httpd.conf) high, so that ASP scripts have a better chance being cached, which happens after they are first compiled. You will also avoid the process fork penalty on UNIX systems. Somewhere between 50 - 500 is probably pretty good. You do not want to set this too high though or you will risk having your web processes use too much RAM. One may use Apache::SizeLimit or Apache::GTopLimit to optimally tune MaxRequestsPerChild at runtime.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Precompile_Modules"
>Precompile Modules</a></h2>

<p>For those modules that your Apache::ASP application uses, make sure that they are loaded in your sites startup.pl file, or loaded with PerlModule in your httpd.conf, so that your modules are compiled pre-fork in the parent httpd.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Precompile_Scripts"
>Precompile Scripts</a></h2>

<p>Precompile your scripts by using the Apache::ASP-&#62;Loader() routine documented below. This will at least save the first user hitting a script from suffering compile time lag. On UNIX, precompiling scripts upon server startup allows this code to be shared with forked child www servers, so you reduce overall memory usage, and use less CPU compiling scripts for each separate www server process. These savings could be significant. On a PII300 Solaris x86, it takes a couple seconds to compile 28 scripts upon server startup, with an average of 50K RAM per compiled script, and this savings is passed on to the ALL child httpd servers, so total savings would be 50Kx28x20(MaxClients)=28M!</p>

<p>Apache::ASP-&#62;Loader() can be called to precompile scripts and even entire ASP applications at server startup. Note also that in modperl, you can precompile modules with the PerlModule config directive, which is highly recommended.</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> Apache::ASP-&#62;Loader($path, $pattern, %config)</pre>

<p>This routine takes a file or directory as its first argument. If a file, that file will be compiled. If a directory, that directory will be recursed, and all files in it whose file name matches $pattern will be compiled. $pattern defaults to .*, which says that all scripts in a directory will be compiled by default.</p>

<p>The %config args, are the config options that you may want set that affect compilation. These options include: Debug, Global, GlobalPackage, DynamicIncludes, IncludesDir, InodeNames, PodComments, StatINC, StatINCMatch, UseStrict, XMLSubsPerlArgs, XMLSubsMatch, and XMLSubsStrict. If your scripts are later run with different config options, your scripts may have to be recompiled.</p>

<p>Here is an example of use in a *.conf file:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> &#60;Perl&#62; 
 Apache::ASP-&#62;Loader(
        &#39;/usr/local/proj/site&#39;, &#34;(asp|htm)\$&#34;, 
        &#39;Global&#39; =&#62; &#39;/proj/perllib&#39;,
        &#39;Debug&#39; =&#62; -3, # see system output when starting apache

        # OPTIONAL configs if you use them in your apache configuration
        # these settings affect how the scripts are compiled and loaded
        &#39;GlobalPackage&#39; =&#62; &#39;SomePackageName&#39;,
        &#39;DynamicIncludes&#39; =&#62; 1, 
        &#39;StatINC&#39; =&#62; 1,         
        &#39;StatINCMatch&#39; =&#62; &#39;My&#39;,
        &#39;UseStrict&#39; =&#62; 1,
        &#39;XMLSubsMatch&#39; =&#62; &#39;my:\w+&#39;,
        &#39;XMLSubsStrict&#39; =&#62; 0 || 1,
        );
 &#60;/Perl&#62;</pre>

<p>This config section tells the server to compile all scripts in c:/proj/site that end in asp or htm, and print debugging output so you can see it work. It also sets the Global directory to be /proj/perllib, which needs to be the same as your real config since scripts are cached uniquely by their Global directory. You will probably want to use this on a production server, unless you cannot afford the extra startup time.</p>

<p>To see precompiling in action, set Debug to 1 for the Loader() and for your application in general and watch your error_log for messages indicating scripts being cached.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="No_.htaccess_or_StatINC"
>No .htaccess or StatINC</a></h2>

<p>Don&#39;t use .htaccess files or the StatINC setting in a production system as there are many more files touched per request using these features. I&#39;ve seen performance slow down by half because of using these. For eliminating the .htaccess file, move settings into *.conf Apache files.</p>

<p>Instead of StatINC, try using the StatINCMatch config, which will check a small subset of perl libraries for changes. This config is fine for a production environment, and if used well might only incur a 10-20% performance penalty, depending on the number of modules your system loads in all, as each module needs to be checked for changes on a per request basis.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Turn_off_Debugging"
>Turn off Debugging</a></h2>

<p>Turn off system debugging by setting Debug to 0-3. Having the system debug config option on slows things down immensely, but can be useful when troubleshooting your application. System level debugging is settings -3 through -1, where user level debugging is 1 to 3. User level debugging is much more light weight depending on how many $Reponse-&#62;Debug() statements you use in your program, and you may want to leave it on.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Memory_Sparing,_NoCache"
>Memory Sparing, NoCache</a></h2>

<p>If you have a lot (1000&#39;s+) of scripts, and limited memory, set NoCache to 1, so that compiled scripts are not cached in memory. You lose about 10-15% in speed for small scripts, but save at least 10K RAM per cached script. These numbers are very rough and will largely depend on the size of your scripts and includes.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Resource_Limits"
>Resource Limits</a></h2>

<p>Make sure your web processes do not use too many resources like CPU or RAM with the handy Apache::Resource module. Such a config might look like:</p>

<pre class="sh_perl"> PerlModule Apache::Resource
 PerlSetEnv PERL_RLIMIT_CPU  1000
 PerlSetEnv PERL_RLIMIT_DATA 60:60</pre>

<p>If ever a web process should begin to take more than 60M ram or use more than 1000 CPU seconds, it will be killed by the OS this way. You only want to use this configuration to protect against runaway processes and web program errors, not for terminating a normally functioning system, so set these limits HIGH!</p>

<p>We&#39;re using Apache::ASP on www.redhat.com. We find Apache::ASP very easy to use, and it&#39;s quick for new developers to get up to speed with it, given that many people have already been exposed to the ASP object model that Apache::ASP is based on.</p>

<p>The documentation is comprehensive and easy to understand, and the community and maintainer have been very helpful whenever we&#39;ve had questions.</p>

<p>I had programmed in Perl for some time ... but, since I also knew VB, I had switched to VB in IIS-ASP for web stuff because of its ease of use in embedding code with HTML ... When I discovered Apache-ASP, it was like a dream come true. I would much rather code in Perl than any other language. Thanks for such a fine product!</p>

<p>After discontinuing Windows-based hosting due to the high cost of software, our clients are thrilled with Apache::ASP and they swear ASP it&#39;s faster than before. Installation was a snap on our 25-server web farm with a small shell script and everything is running perfectly! The documentation is very comprehensive and everyone has been very helpful during this migration.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>I would like to say that your ASP module rocks :-) We have practically stopped developing in anything else about half a year ago, and are now using Apache::ASP extensively. I just love Perl, and whereever we are not &#34;forced&#34; to use JSP, we chose ASP. It is fast, reliable, versatile, documented in a way that is the best for professionals - so thank you for writting and maintaining it!</p>

<p>As we have seen with WebTime, Apache::ASP is not only good for the development of website, but also for the development of webtools. Since I first discoverd it, I made it a must-have in my society by taking traditional PHP users to the world of perl afficionados.</p>

<p>Having the possibility to use Apache::ASP with mod_perl or mod_cgi make it constraintless to use because of CGI&#39;s universality and perl&#39;s portability.</p>

<p>First, I just want to say that I am very very impressed with Apache::ASP. I just want to gush with praise after looking at many other implementations of perl embedded code and being very underwhelmed. This is so damn slick and clean. Kudos! ...</p>

<p>... I&#39;m very pleased how quickly I&#39;ve been able to mock up the application. I&#39;ve been writing Perl CGI off and on since 1993(!) and I can tell you that Apache::ASP is a pleasure. (Last year I tried Zope and just about threw my computer out the window.)</p>

<p>Working in a team environment where you have HTML coders and perl coders, Apache::ASP makes it easy for the HTML folks to change the look of the page without knowing perl. Using Apache::ASP (instead of another embedded perl solution) allows the HTML jockeys to use a variety of HTML tools that understand ASP, which reduces the amount of code they break when editing the HTML. Using Apache::ASP instead of M$ ASP allows us to use perl (far superior to VBScript) and Apache (far superior to IIS).</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been very pleased with Apache::ASP and its support.</p>

<p>Apache::ASP has been a great tool. Just a little background.... the whole site had been in cgi flat files when I started here. I was looking for a technology that would allow me to write the objects and NEVER invoke CGI.pm... I found it and hopefuly I will be able to implement this every site I go to.</p>

<p>When I got here there was a huge argument about needing a game engine and I belive this has been the key... Games are approx. 10 time faster than before. The games don&#39;t break anylonger. All in all a great tool for advancement.</p>

<p>...we ported our biggest yet ASP site from IIS (well, actually rewrote), Cine.gr and it is a killer site. In some cases, the whole thing got almost 25 (no typo) times faster... None of this would ever be possible without Apache::ASP (I do not ever want to write ``print &#34;&#60;HTML&#62;\n&#34;;&#39;&#39; again).</p>

<p>Apache::ASP has been in development since 1998, and was production ready since its .02 release. Releases are always used in a production setting before being made publically available.</p>

<p>In July 2000, the version numbers of releases went from .19 to 1.9 which is more relevant to software development outside the perl community. Where a .10 perl module usually means first production ready release, this would be the equivalent of a 1.0 release for other kinds of software.</p>

 --Fixed a bug which would cause Session_OnEnd to be called twice on sessions in a certain case,
   particularly when an old expired session gets reused by and web browser... this bug was
   a result of a incomplete session cleanup method in this case.  Thanks to Oleg Kobyakovskiy 
   for reporting this bug.  Added test in t/session_events.t to cover this problem going forward.

 - Compile errors from Apache::ASP-&#62;Loader() were not being reported.  They will

 + use of chr(hex($1)) to decode URI encoded parameters instead of pack(&#34;c&#34;,hex($1))
   faster &#38; more correct, thanks to Nikolay Melekhin for pointing out this need.

 (d) Added old perlmonth.com articles to ./site/articles in distribution

 (d) Updated documention for the $Application-&#62;SessionCount API

 + Scripts with named subroutines, which is warned against in the style guide,
   will not be cached to help prevent my closure problems that often

   Thanks to Richard Curtis for reporting bug &#38; subsequent testing.

 - When GlobalPackage config changes, but global.asa has not, global.asa
   will be recompiled anyway to update the GlobalPackage correctly.
   Changing GlobalPackage before would cause errors if global.asa was
   already compiled.

 ++ For ANY PerlSetVar type config, OFF/Off/off will be assumed 
    to have value of 0 for that setting.  Before, only a couple settings

   Also make cookies headers sorted by cookie and dictionary key 
   while building headers for repeatable behavior, this latter was 
   to facilitate testing.

 - fixed $Server-&#62;Mail error_log output when failing to connect
   to SMTP server.

 + added tests to cover UniquePackages &#38; NoCache configs since this
   config logic was updated

 + made deprecated warnings for use of certain $Response-&#62;Member
   calls more loudly write to error_log, so I can remove the AUTOLOAD
   for Response one day

 - Probably fixed behavior in CgiHeaders, at least under perl 5.8.0, and
   added t/cgi_headers.t to cover this config.

 + removed $Apache::ASP::CompressGzip setting ability, used to possibly
   set CompressGzip in the module before, not documented anyway

   at runtime, which was bad for Apache::DBI on win32 a long
   time ago:

    $Apache::ServerStarting and $Apache::ServerStarting = 0;

   If this code is still needed in Apache::ASP-&#62;handler() let
   me know.

 + check to make sure data in internal database is a HASH ref
   before using it for session garbage collection.  This is to
   help prevent against internal database corruption in a 
   network share that does not support flock() file locking.

 + For new XMLSubs ASP type &#60;%= %&#62; argument interpolation
   activated with XMLSubsPerlArgs 0, data references can now
   be passed in addition to SCALAR/string references, so one
   can pass an object reference like so:

   This will only work as long as the variable interpolation &#60;%= %&#62;

 ++Optimization for static HTML/XML files that are served up 
  via Apache::ASP so that they are not compiled into perl subroutines
  first.  This makes especially native XSLT both faster &#38; take
  less memory to serve, before XSL &#38; XML files being transformed
  by XSLT would both be compiled as normal ASP script first, so 
  now this will happen if they really are ASP scripts with embedded
  &#60;% %&#62; code blocks &#38; XMLSubs being executed.

 +Consolidate some config data for Apache::ASP-&#62;Loader to use
  globals in @Apache::ASP::CompileChecksumKeys to know which 
  config data is important for precompiling ASP scripts.

 +Further streamlined code compilation.  Now both base
  scripts and includes use the internal CompileInclude() API
  to generate code.

 -Fixed runtime HTML error output when Debug is set to -2/2,
  so that script correctly again gets rendered in final perl form.
  Added compile time error output to ./site/eg/syntax_error.htm
  when a special link is clicked for a quick visual test.

 -Cleaned up some bad coding practices in ./site/eg/global.asa
  associated changes in other example files.  Comment example
  global.asa some for the first time reader

 -DemoASP.pm examples module needed &#34;use strict&#34; fix, thanks
  to Allan Vest for bug report

 --$rv = $Response-&#62;Include({ File =&#62; ..., Cache =&#62; 1});
  now works to get the first returned value fetched from
  the cache.  Before, because a list was always returned,
  $rv would have been equal to the number of items returned,
  even if the return value list has just one element.

 (d) added site/robots.txt file with just a comment for
     search engine indexing

 -fixed ./site/eg/binary_write.htm to not use 
  $Response-&#62;{ContentLength} because it does not exist.

<pre class="sh_perl"> - fixed up t/server_mail.t test to skip if a sendmail server
   is not available on localhost.  We only want the test to run
   if there is a server to test against.

 + removed cgi/asp script, just a symlink now to the ./asp-perl script
   which in this way deprecates it.  I had it hard linked, but the 
   distribution did not untar very well on win32 platform.

 + Reordered the modules in Bundle::Apache::ASP for a cleaner install.

 - Fixed bug where XMLSubs where removing &#60;?xml version ... ?&#62; tag
   when it was needed in XSLT mode.

 + $Server-&#62;Mail({ CC =&#62; &#39;...&#39;, BCC =&#62; &#39;...&#39; }), now works to send
   CC &#38; BCC headers/recipients.

 + Removed $Apache::ASP::Register definition which defined the current
   executing Apache::ASP object.  Only one part of the application was
   using it, and this has been fixed.  This would have been an unsafe
   use of globals for a threaded environment.

 + Decreased latency when doing Application_OnStart, used to sleep(1) 
   for CleanupMaster sync, but this is not necessary for Application_OnStart 
   scenario

 + Restructure code / core templates for MailErrorsTo funcationality.  
   Wrote test mail_error.t to cover this.  $ENV{REMOTE_USER} will now 
   be displayed in the MailErrorsTo message when defined from 401 basic auth.

 + $Server-&#62;RegisterCleanup should be thread safe now, as it no longer relies
   on access to @Apache::ASP::Cleanup for storing the CODE ref stack.

 + test t/inode_names.t for InodeNames and other file tests covering case
   of long file names.

 - Fixed long file name sub identifier bug.  Added test t/long_names.t.

 + CacheDir may now be set independently of StateDir.  It used to default
   to StateDir if it was set.

 ++ Decomposition of modules like Apache::ASP::Session &#38; Apache::ASP::Application

   light requests that do not load $Session &#38; $Application, requests
   run at 3.4 hits/sec, this is on a dual PIII-450 linux 2.4.x

 - Caching like for XSLTCache now works in CGI mode.  
   This was a bug that it did not before.

   The syntax for loading a shared include is to prefix the file
   name with Share:: as in:

    $Response-&#62;TrapInclude(&#39;Share::CORE/MailError.inc&#39;);

   New test to cover this at t/share.t

   This feature is experimental.  The naming convention may change

 + asp-perl script now uses ./asp.conf instead of ./asp.config
   for runtime configuration via %Config defined there.  Update docs
   for running in standalone CGI mode

 + Make use of MANFEST.SKIP to not publish the dev/* files anymore.

 - Script_OnEnd guaranteed to run after $Response-&#62;End, but 
   it will not run if there was an error earlier in the request.

 + lots of new test cases covering behaviour of $Response-&#62;End
   and $Response-&#62;Redirect under various conditions like XMLSubs
   and SoftRedirect and global.asa Script_OnStart

 + asp-perl will be installed into the bin executables when
   Apache::ASP is installed.  asp-perl is the command line version
   of Apache::ASP that can also be used to run script in CGI mode.
   Test case covering asp-perl functionality.

 + asp CGI/command line script now called asp-perl.  I picked this 
   name because Apache::ASP often has the name asp-perl in distributions
   of the module.

 + Apache::ASP::CGI::Test class now subclass of Apache::ASP::CGI.  To facilitate
   this Apache::ASP::CGI::init() now called OO like Apache::ASP::CGI-&#62;init()
   Fixed up places where the old style was called.  New Test class allows
   a dummy Apache request object to be built which caches header &#38; body output
   for later inspection instead of writing it to STDOUT.

 - $Response-&#62;Redirect() under SoftRedirect 1 will not first Clear() buffer

 - $Response-&#62;Redirect() in an XMLSubs will work now ... behavior
   of $Response-&#62;Flush() being turned off in an XMLSubs was interfering with this.

 + srand() init tracking done better, thanks for patch from Ime Smits

 + Added file/directory being used for precompilation in 
   Apache::ASP-&#62;Loader($file, ...) to output like:

    [Mon Feb 04 20:19:22 2002] [error] [asp] 4215 (re)compiled 22 scripts 
      of 22 loaded for $file

   This is so that when precompiling multiple web sites
   each with different directories, one can easier see the 
   compile output relevant to the Loader() command being run.

 + better decomp of Apache::ASP site build files at ./build/* files,
   which is good should anyone look at it for ideas.

 + improved test suite to error when unintended output results from
   t/*.t test scripts.

   for these headers: Content-Type, Cache-Control, Expires.  This is to avoid
   both the application &#38; Apache::ASP sending out duplicate headers.  Added
   test cases for this to t/response.t

 --Fixed SessionCount / Session_OnEnd bug, where these things were not
  working for $Sessions that never had anything written to them.
  This bug was introduced in 2.23/2.25 release.

  There was an optimization in 2.23/2.25 where a $Session that was never
  used does not write its state lock file &#38; dbm files to disk, only if
  it gets written too like $Session-&#62;{MARK}++.  Tracking of these NULL $Sessions 
  then is handled solely in the internal database.  For $Session garbage 
  collection though which would fire Session_OnEnd events and update 
  SessionCount, the Apache::ASP::State-&#62;GroupMembers() function was just 
  looking for state files on disk ... now it looks in the internal database 
  too for SessionID records for garbage collection.

  Added a test at ./t/session_events.t for these things.

 +Some optimizations for $Session API use.

 +Added support for XSLT via XML::LibXSLT, patch courtesy of Michael Buschauer

 -Got rid of an warning when recompiling changing includes under perl 5.6.1...
  undef($code) method did not work for this perl version, rather undef(&#38;$code) does.
  Stopped using using Apache::Symbol for this when available.

 -Make Apache::ASP script run under perl taint checking -T for perl 5.6.1...
  $code =~ tr///; does not work to untaint here, so much use the slower:
  $code =~ /^(.*)$/s; $code = $1; method to untaint.

 -Check for inline includes changing, included in a dynamic included
  loaded at runtime via $Response-&#62;Include().  Added test case for
  this at t/include_change.t.  If an inline include of a dynamic include
  changes, the dynamic include should get recompiled now.

 -Make OK to use again with PerlTaintCheck On, with MLDBM::Sync 2.25.
  Fixed in ASP.pm, t/global.asa, and created new t/taint_check.t test script

 +Load more modules when Apache::ASP is loaded so parent will share more

   Apache::Symbol 
   Devel::Symdump 
   Config 
   lib 
   MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File

 +When FileUploadMax bytes is exceeded for a file upload, there will not
  be an odd error anymore resulting from $CGI::POST_MAX being triggered,
  instead the file upload input will simply be ignored via $CGI::DISABLE_UPLOADS.
  This gives the developer the opportunity to tell the user the the file upload
  was too big, as demonstrated by the ./site/eg/file_upload.asp example.

  To not let the web client POST a lot of data to your scripts as a form
  of a denial of service attack use the apache config LimitRequestBody for the 
  max limits.  You can think of PerlSetVar FileUploadMax as a soft limit, and 
  apache&#39;s LimitRequestBody as a hard limit.

 --Under certain circumstances with file upload, it seems that IsClientConnected() 
  would return an aborted client value from $r-&#62;connection-&#62;aborted, so
  the buffer output data would not be flushed to the client, and 
  the HTML page would return to the browser empty.  This would be under
  normal file upload use.  One work-around was to make sure to initialize
  the $Request object before $Response-&#62;IsClientConnected is called,
  then $r-&#62;connection-&#62;aborted returns the right value.
  
  This problem was probably introduced with IsClientConnected() code changes
  starting in the 2.25 release.</pre>

 + removed ./dev directory from distribution, useless clutter

 + Removed dependency on HTTP::Date by taking code into
   Apache::ASP as Apache::ASP::Date.  This relieves
   the dependency of Apache::ASP on libwww LWP libraries.
   If you were using HTTP::Date functions before without loading
   &#34;use HTTP::Date;&#34; on your own, you will have to do this now.

 + Streamlined code execution.  Especially worked on 
   $Response-&#62;IsClientConnected which gets called during
   a normal request execution, and got rid of IO::Select
   dependency. Some function style calls instead of OO style 
   calls where private functions were being invokes that one 
   would not need to override.

 - Fixed possible bug when flushing a data buffer where there
   is just a &#39;0&#39; in it.

 + Updated docs to note that StateCache config was deprecated
   as of 2.23.  Removed remaining code that referenced the config.

 + Removed references to unused OrderCollections code.

 - Better Cache meta key, lower chance of collision with 
   unrelated data since its using the full MD5 keyspace now

 + Optimized some debugging statements that resulted 
   from recent development.

 + Tie::TextDir .04 and above is supported for StateDB
   and CacheDB settings with MLDBM::Sync .21. This is good for 
   CacheDB where output is larger and there are not many 
   versions to cache, like for XSLTCache, where the site is

 -Only remove outermost &#60;SCRIPT&#62; tags from global.asa
  for IIS/PerlScript compatibility.  Used to remove
  all &#60;SCRIPT&#62; tags, which hurt when some subs in globa.asa
  would be printing some JavaScript.

 +$Response-&#62;{IsClientConnected} now updated correctly

  can be used for accurate accounting, while 
  $Response-&#62;{IsClientConnected} only gets updated
  after $Response-&#62;Flush().  Added test cases to response.t

 +$Server-&#62;HTMLEncode(\$data) API extension, now can take

  for data 100K in size.

 -Access to $Application is locked when Application_OnEnd &#38; 
  Application_OnStart is called, creating a critical section
  for use of $Application

 ++MLDBM::Sync used now for core DBM support in Apache::ASP::State.
  This drastically simplifies/stabilizes the code in there
  and will make it easier for future SQL database plugins.

 +New API for accessing ASP object information in non content
  handler phases:

    use Apache::ASP;
    sub My::Auth::handler {
      my $r = shift;
      my $ASP = Apache::ASP-&#62;new($r) 
      my $Session = $ASP-&#62;Session;
    }

  In the above example, $Session would be the same $Session
  object created later while running the ASP script for this
  same request.  

  Added t/asp_object.t test for this.  Fixed global.asa to only 
  init StateDir when application.asp starts which is the first 
  test script to run.

 -Fixed on Win32 to make Apache::ASP-&#62;new($r) able to create
  multiple master ASP objects per request.  Was not reentrant 
  safe before, particularly with state locking for dbms like 
  $Application &#38; $Session.  

 ++Output caching for includes, built on same layer ( extended )
  as XSLTCache, test suite at t/cache.t.  Enabled with special 
  arguments to 

    $Response-&#62;Include(\%args, @include_args)
    $Response-&#62;TrapInclude(\%args, @include_args)
    $Server-&#62;Execute(\%args, @include_args)

  where %args = (
    File =&#62; &#39;file.inc&#39;,
    Cache =&#62; 1, # to activate cache layer
    Expires =&#62; 3600, # to expire in one hour
    LastModified =&#62; time() - 600, # to expire if cached before 10 minutes ago
    Key =&#62; $Request-&#62;Form, # to cache based on checksum of serialized form data,
    Clear =&#62; 1, # to not allow fetch from cache this time, will always execute include
  );

  Like the XSLTCache, it uses MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File
  by default, but can use DB_File or GDBM_File if
  CacheDB is set to these.

  See t/cache.t for API support until this is documented.

 +CacheSize now supports units of M, K, B like 

   CacheSize 10M
   CacheSize 10240K
   CacheSize 10000000B
   CacheSize 10000000

 -Better handling of $Session-&#62;Abandon() so multiple
  request to the same session while its being destroyed
  will have the right effect.

 +Optimized XMLSubs parsing.  Scripts with lots lof XMLSubs 
  now parse faster for the first time.  One test script with 
  almost 200 such tags went from a parse time of around 3 seconds
  to .7 seconds after optimizations.

 +Updated performance tuning docs, particularly for using
  Apache::ASP-&#62;Loader()

 +$Server-&#62;URL($url, \%params) now handles array refs
  in the params values like
    $Server-&#62;URL($url, { key =&#62; [ qw( value1 value2 ) ] })

  This is so that query string data found in 
  $Request-&#62;QueryString that gets parsed into this form
  from a string like: ?key=value&#38;key=value2 would be 
  able to be reused passed back to $Server-&#62;URL to 
  create self referencing URLs more easily.

 -Bug fix where XMLSubs like &#60;s:td /&#62; now works on perl 
  5.005xx, thanks to Philip Mak for reporting &#38; fix.

 +When searching for included files, will now join
  the absolute path of the directory of the script
  with the name of the file if its a relative file
  name like ./header.inc.  Before, would just look

<pre class="sh_perl"> -+-+ Session Manager
  empty state group directories are not removed, thus alleviating
  one potential race condition.  This impacted performance
  on idle sites severely as there were now 256 directories
  to check, so made many performance enhancements to the 
  session manager.  The session manager is built to handle
  up to 20,000 client sessions over a 20 minute period.  It
  will slow the system down as it approaches this capacity.

  One such enhancement was session-ids now being 11 bytes long 
  so that its .lock file is only 16 characters in length.  
  Supposedly some file systems lookup files 16 characters or 
  less in a fast hashed lookup.  This new session-id has
  4.4 x 10^12 possible values.  I try to keep this space as
  large as possible to prevent a brute force attack.

  Another enhancement was to limit the group directories
  to 64 by only allowing the session-id prefix to be [0-3][0-f]
  instead of [0-f][0-f], checking 64 empty directories on an
  idle site takes little time for the session manager, compared
  to 256 which felt significant from the client end, especially
  on Win32 where requests are serialized.  

  If upgrading to this version, you would do well to delete
  empty StateDir group directories while your site is idle.
  Upgrading during an idle time will have a similar effect,
  as old Apache::ASP versions would delete empty directories.

 -$Application-&#62;GetSession($session_id) now creates
  an session object that only lasts until the next
  invocation of $Application-&#62;GetSession().  This is 
  to avoid opening too many file handles at once,
  where each session requires opening a lock file.

  Note ASP collections start counting at 1.

 --fixed race condition, where multiple processes might 
  try creating the same state directory at the same time, with
  one winning, and one generating an error.  Now, web process
  will recheck for directory existence and error if 
  it doesn&#39;t. 

 -global.asa compilation will be cached correctly, not
  sure when this broke.  It was getting reloaded every request.

 -StateAllWrite config, when set creates state files
  with a+rw or 0666 permissions, and state directories
  with a+rwx or 0777 permissions.  This allows web servers
  running as different users on the same machine to share a

 --Backup flock() unlocking try for QNX will not corrupt the 
  normal flock() LOCK_UN usage, after trying to unlock a file
  that doesn&#39;t exist.  This bug was uncovered from the below

  There was a race condition where a new group directory would
  be created, but then deleted by a garbage collector before
  it could be initialized correctly with new state files.

 +Better random session-id checksums for $Session creation.
  per process srand() initialization, because srand()

  Call without arguments to rely on perl&#39;s decent rand
  seeding.  Then when calling rand() in Secret() we have
  enough random data, that even if someone else calls srand()
  to something fixed, should not mess things up terribly since

  references.

  XSLTMatch is a regexp that matches XML file names, like \.xml$,

  XSLTCacheSize when specified uses Tie::Cache to cached XML DOMs

 -bug fix on object initialization optimization earlier

 +Apache::ASP::Parse() takes a file name, scalar, or
  scalar ref for arguments of data to parse for greater
  integration ability with other applications.

 +PodComments optimization, small speed increase at
  compilation time.

 +String optimization on internal rendering that avoids 
  unnecessary copying of static html, by using refs.  Should 
  make a small difference on sites with large amounts of 
  static html.

 +CompressGzip setting which, when Compress::Zlib is installed,

  browser if the client supports gzip encoding.

 ++Script_OnFlush event handler, and auxiliary work optimizing
  asp events in general.  $Response-&#62;{BinaryRef} created which
  is a reference to outgoing output, which can be used 
  to modify the data at runtime before it goes out to the client. 

 +Some code optimizations that boost speed from 22 to 24 
  hits per second when using Sessions without $Application,
  on a simple hello world benchmark on a WinNT PII300.

 ++Better SessionManagement, more aware of server farms that 
  don&#39;t have reliable NFS locking.  The key here is to have only
  one process on one server in charge of session garbage collection
  at any one time, and try to create this situation with a snazzy
  CleanupMaster routine.  This is done by having a process register
  itself in the internal database with a server key created at
  apache start time.  If this key gets stale, another process can 
  become the master, and this period will not exceed the period
  SessionTimeout / StateManager.

  ** Work on session manager sponsored by LRN, <a href="http://www.lrn.com" class="podlinkurl"

  ** This work was used to deploy a server farm in production with  **

  ** open source. :)                                                **

  Future work for server farm capabilities might include breaking
  up the internal database into one of 256 internal databases 
  hashed by the first 2 chars of the session id.  Also on the plate
  is Apache::Session like abilities with locking and/or data storage
  occuring in a SQL database.  The first dbs to be done will include
  MySQL &#38; Oracle.

 +Better session security which will create a new session id for an 
  incoming session id that does not match one already seen.  This will
  help for those with Search engines that have bookmarked
  pages with the session ids in the query strings.  This breaks away
  from standard ASP session id implementation which will automatically
  use the session id presented by the browser, now a new session id will
  be returned if the presented one is invalid or expired.

 -$Application-&#62;GetSession will only return a session if
  one already existed.  It would create one before by default.

 +Script_OnFlush global.asa event handler, and $Response-&#62;{BinaryRef}
  member which is a scalar reference to the content about to be flushed.
  See ./site/eg/global.asa for example usage, used in this case to

 -tracking of subroutines defined in scripts and includes so 
  StatINC won&#39;t undefine them when reloading the GlobalPackage, 
  and so an warning will be logged when another script redefines 
  the same subroutine name, which has been the bane of at least
  a few developers.

 -Loader() will now recompile dynamic includes that 
  have changed, even if main including script has not.
  This is useful if you are using Loader() in a 
  PerlRestartHandler, for reloading scripts when
  gracefully restarting apache.

 -Apache::ASP used to always set the status to 200 by 
  default explicitly with $r-&#62;status().  This would be 
  a problem if a script was being used to as a 404 
  ErrorDocument, because it would always return a 200 error
  code, which is just wrong.  $Response-&#62;{Status} is now 
  undefined by default and will only be used if set by 
  the developer.  

  Note that by default a script will still return a 200 status, 
  but $Response-&#62;{Status} may be used to override this behavior.

 +$Server-&#62;Config($setting) API extension that allows developer
  to access config settings like Global, StateDir, etc., and is a 
  wrapper around Apache-&#62;dir_config($setting)

 +Loader() will log the number of scripts
  recompiled and the number of scripts checked, instead
  of just the number of scripts recompiled, which is
  misleading as it reports 0 for child httpds after
  a parent fork that used Loader() upon startup.

  FileUpload configs and $Request-&#62;FileUpload collection.
  Documented StatScripts.

 +StatScripts setting which if set to 0 will not reload
  includes, global.asa, or scripts when changed.

 +FileUpload file handles cleanup at garbage collection
  time so developer does not have to worry about lazy coding
  and undeffing filehandles used in code.  Also set 
  uploaded filehandles to binmode automatically on Win32 
  platforms, saving the developer yet more typing.

 +FileUploadTemp setting, default 0, if set will leave
  a temp file on disk during the request, which may be 
  helpful for processing by other programs, but is also
  a security risk in that others could potentially read 
  this file while the script is running. 

  The path to the temp file will be available at
  $Request-&#62;{FileUpload}{$form_field}{TempFile}.
  The regular use of file uploads remains the same
  with the &#60;$filehandle&#62; to the upload at 
  $Request-&#62;{Form}{$form_field}.

 +FileUploadMax setting, default 0, currently an 
  alias for $CGI::POST_MAX, which determines the 
  max size for a file upload in bytes.  

 +SessionQueryParse only auto parses session-ids
  into links when a session-id COOKIE is NOT found.
  This feature is only enabled then when a user has
  disabled cookies, so the runtime penalty of this
  feature won&#39;t drag down the whole site, since most
  users will have cookies turned on.   

 -StatINC &#38; StatINCMatch will not undef Fnctl.pm flock 
  functions constants like O_RDWR, because the code references
  are not well trackable.  This would result in sporadic 500 server
  errors when a changed module was reloaded that imported O_* flock 
  functions from Fnctl.

 +SessionQueryParse &#38; SessionQueryParseMatch
  settings that enable auto parsing session ids into 
  URLs for cookieless sessions.  Will pick up URLs in 
  &#60;a href&#62;, &#60;area href&#62;, &#60;form action&#62;, &#60;frame src&#62;,
  &#60;iframe src&#62;, &#60;img src&#62;, &#60;input src&#62;, &#60;link href&#62;
  $Response-&#62;Redirect($URL) and the first URL in 
  script tags like &#60;script&#62;*.location.href=$URL&#60;/script&#62;

  These settings require that buffering be enabled, as
  Apache::ASP will parse through the buffer to parse the URLs.

  With SessionQueryParse on, it will just parse non-absolute
  URLs, but with SessionQueryParseMatch set to some server
  url regexp, like ^<a href="http://localhost" class="podlinkurl"
>http://localhost</a> , will also parse
  in the session id for URLs that match that.

  When testing, the performance hit from this parsing
  a script dropped from 12.5 hits/sec on my WinNT box
  to 11.7 hits per second for 1K of buffered output.
  The difference is .007 of my PII300&#39;s processing power
  per second.

  For 10K of output then, my guess is that this speed
  of script, would be slowed to 6.8 hits per second.
  This kind of performance hit would also slow a
  script running at 40 hits per second on a UNIX box
  to 31 hits/sec for 1K, and to 11 hits/sec for 10K parsed.

  Your mileage may vary and you will have to test the difference
  yourself.  Get yourself a valid URL with a session-id in
  it, and run it through ab, or Socrates, with SessionQuery
  turned on, and then with SessionQueryParse set to see 
  the difference.  SessionQuery just enables of session id
  setting from the query string but will not auto parse urls.

 -If buffering, Content-Length will again be set.
  It broke, probably while I was tuning in the past 
  couple versions.

 +UseStrict setting compiles all scripts including
  global.asa with &#34;use strict&#34; turned on for catching
  more coding errors.  With this setting enabled,
  use strict errors die during compilation forcing
  Apache::ASP to try to recompile the script until
  successful.

 -Object use in includes like $Response-&#62;Write() 
  no longer error with &#34;use strict&#34; programming.  

 +SessionQuery config setting with $Server-&#62;URL($url, { %params } ) 
  alpha API extensions to enable cookieless sessions.

 +Debugging not longer produces internal debugging
  by default.  Set to -1,-2 for internal debugging
  for Debug settings 1 &#38; 2.

 +Both StateSerializer &#38; StateDB can be changed 
  without affecting a live web site, by storing 
  the configurations for $Application &#38; $Session 
  in an internal database, so that if $Session was

  it will keep this StateDB setting until it ends.

 +StateSerializer config setting.  Default Data::Dumper,
  can also be set to Storable.  Controls how data is

  $Application / $Session setup process.  Bench is up to 
  22 from 21 hits / sec on dev NT box.

        42 hits per sec on Apache::ASP HelloWorld bench
        46 hits per sec on Embperl (1.2b10) and
        51 hits per sec for CGI Apache::Registry scripts  

  Before Apache::ASP was clocking some 31 hits per sec.
  Apache::ASP also went from 75 to 102 hits per second 
  on Solaris.

 +PerlTaintCheck On friendly.  This is mod_perl&#39;s way 
  of providing -T taint checking.  When Apache::ASP
  is used with state objects like $Session or $Application,
  MLDBM must also be made taint friendly with:

    $MLDBM::RemoveTaint = 1;

  which could be put in the global.asa.  Documented.

 +Added $Response-&#62;ErrorDocument($error_code, $uri_or_string) 
  API extension which allows for setting of Apache&#39;s error
  document at runtime.  This is really just a wrapper 
  for Apache-&#62;custom_response() renamed so it syncs with
  the Apache ErrorDocument config setting.  Updated
  documentation, and added error_document.htm example.

 =OrderCollections setting was added, but then REMOVED
  because it was not going to be used.  It bound 
  $Request-&#62;* collections/hashes to Tie::IxHash, so that data
  in those collections would be read in the order the 
  browser sent it, when eaching through or with keys.

 -global.asa will be reloaded when changed.  This broke
  when I optimized the modification times with (stat($file))[9]
  rather than &#34;use File::stat; stat($file)-&#62;mtime&#34;

 -Make Apache::ASP-&#62;Loader() PerlRestartHandler safe,

 -IncludesDir config now works with DynamicIncludes.

 +DebugBufferLength feature added, giving control to 
  how much buffered output gets shown when debugging errors.

 ++Tuning of $Response-&#62;Write(), which processes all
  static html internally, to be almost 50% faster for
  its typical use, when BufferingOn is enabled, and 
  CgiHeaders are disabled, both being defaults.

  This can show significant speed improvements for tight
  loops that render ASP output.

 +Auto linking of ./site/eg/ text to example scripts
  at web site.

  allows a script to error cleanly in the middle of execution.  

 +more bullet proof loading of Apache::Symbol, changed the 
  way Apache::ASP loads modules in general.  It used to 
  check for the module to load every time, if it hadn&#39;t loaded
  successfully before, but now it just tries once per httpd,
  so the web server will have to be restarted to see new installed
  modules.  This is just for modules that Apache::ASP relies on.

  Old modules that are changed or updated with an installation
  are still reloaded with the StatINC settings if so configured. 

 +ASP web site wraps &#60;font face=&#34;courier new&#34;&#62; around &#60;pre&#62;
  tags now to override the other font used for the text
  areas.  The spacing was all weird in Netscape before
  for &#60;pre&#62; sections.

 -Fixed Content-Length calculation when using the Clean
  option, so that the length is calculated after the HTML
  is clean, not before.  This would cause a browser to 
  hang sometimes.

 +Added IncludesDir config option that if set will also be
  used to check for includes, so that includes may easily be
  shared between applications.  By default only Global and 
  the directory the script is in are checked for includes.

  Also added IncludesDir as a possible configuration option
  for Apache::ASP-&#62;Loader()

 -Re-enabled the Application_OnStart &#38; OnEnd events, after
  breaking them when implementing the AllowApplicationState
  config setting.

 +Better pre-fork caching ... StatINC &#38; StatINCMatch are now 
  args for Apache::ASP-&#62;Loader(), so StatINC symbols loading
  may be done pre-fork and shared between httpds.  This lowers
  the child httpd init cost of StatINC.  Documented.

 +Made Apache::ASP Basic Authorization friendly so authentication
  can be handled by ASP scripts.  If AuthName and AuthType Apache
  config directives are set, and a $Response-&#62;{Status} is set to 
  401, a user will be prompted for username/password authentication
  and the entered data will show up in ServerVariables as:
    $env = $Request-&#62;ServerVariables
    $env-&#62;{REMOTE_USER} = $env-&#62;{AUTH_USER} = username
    $env-&#62;{AUTH_PASSWD} = password
    $env-&#62;{AUTH_NAME}   = your realm
    $env-&#62;{AUTH_TYPE}   = &#39;Basic&#39;

  This is the same place to find auth data as if Apache had some 
  authentication handler deal with the auth phase separately.

<pre class="sh_perl"> --State databases like $Session, $Application are 
  now tied/untied to every lock/unlock triggered by read/write 
  access.  This was necessary for correctness issues, so that 
  database file handles are flushed appropriately between writes
  in a highly concurrent multi-process environment.

  This problem raised its ugly head because under high volume, 
  a DB_File can become corrupt if not flushed correctly.  
  Unfortunately, there is no way to flush SDBM_Files &#38; DB_Files 
  consistently other than to tie/untie the databases every access.

  DB_File may be used optionally for StateDB, but the default is
  to use SDBM_File which is much faster, but limited to 1024 byte
  key/value pairs.

  For SDBM_Files before, if there were too many concurrent 
  writes to a shared database like $Application, some of the 
  writes would not be saved because another process
  might overwrite the changes with its own.

  There is now a 10 fold performance DECREASE associated
  with reading from and writing to files like $Session 
  and $Application.  With rough benchmarks I can get about
  100 increments (++) now per second to $Session-&#62;{count}, where
  before I could get 1000 increments / second.  

  You can improve this if you have many reads / writes happening
  at the same time, by placing locking code around the group like
  
        $Session-&#62;Lock();
        $Session-&#62;{count}++;
        $Session-&#62;{count}++;
        $Session-&#62;{count}++;
        $Session-&#62;UnLock();     

  This method will reduce the number of ties to the $Session database
  from 6 to 1 for this kind of code, and will improve the performance
  dramatically.

  Also, instead of using explicit $Session locking, you can 
  create an automatic lock on $Session per script by setting
  SessionSerialize in your config to 1.  The danger here is
  if you have any long running scripts, the user will have
  to wait for it to finish before another script can be run.

  To see the number of lock/unlocks or ties/unties to each database
  during a script execution, look at the last lines of debug output
  to your error log when Debug is set to 1.  This can help you
  performance tweak access to these databases.

 +Updated documentation with new config settings and
  API extensions.

 +Added AllowApplicationState config option which allows
  you to leave $Application undefined, and will not
  execute Application_OnStart or Application_OnEnd.
  This can be a slight performance increase of 2-3% if
  you are not using $Application, but are using $Session.

 +Added $Session-&#62;Lock() / $Session-&#62;UnLock() API routines
  necessary additions since access to session is not
  serialized by default like IIS ASP.  Also prompted
  by change in locking code which retied to SDBM_File
  or DB_File each lock.  If you $Session-&#62;Lock / UnLock
  around many read/writes, you will increase performance.

 +Added StateCache config which, if set will cache
  the file handle locks for $Application and an internal 
  database used for tracking $Session info.  This caching can 
  make an ASP application perform up to 10% faster,
  at a cost of each web server process holding 2 more 
  cached file handles open, per ASP application using
  this configuration.  The data written to or read from
  these state databases is not cached, just the locking 
  file handles are held open.

 -Added in much more locking in session manager 
  and session garbage collector to help avoid collisions
  between the two.  There were definite windows that the
  two would collide in, during which bad things could 
  happen on a high volume site.

  StatINCMatch should be safe to use in production with CGI.

  I think the regexp that I was using had O(n^2) characteristics

  For information on PerlScript compatibility, see the PerlScript

 -Added UniquePackages config option, that if set brings back 
  the old method of compiling each ASP script into its own

  into the same package, so that scripts, dynamic includes &#38; global.asa
  can share globals.  This BROKE scripts in the same ASP Application
  that defined the same sub routines, as their subs would redefine

  UniquePackages has scripts compiled into separate perl packages,

  Under this settings, scripts will not be able to share globals.

 +Optimized reloading of the GlobalPackage perl module upon changes, 
  so that scripts and dynamic includes don&#39;t have to be recompiled.  
  The global.asa will still have to be though.  Since we started
  compiling all routines into a package that can be named with
  GlobalPackage, we&#39;ve been undeffing compiled scripts and includes
  when the real GlobalPackage changed on disk, as we do a full sweep
  through the namespace.  Now, we skip those subs that we know to 
  be includes or scripts. 

 -Using Apache::Symbol::undef() to undefine precompiled scripts
  and includes when reloading those scripts.  Doing just an undef() 
  would sometimes result in an &#34;active subroutine undef&#34; error.
  This bug came out when I started thrashing the StatINC system

  a 5% performance penalty.

 +Using pod style commenting no longer confuses the line
  numbering.  ASP script line numbers are almost exactly match

  (not dynamic) insert extra text which can confuse line numbering.
  If you want perl error line numbers to entirely sync with your 
  ASP scripts, I would suggest learning how to use dynamic includes,
  as opposed to inline includes.

  @vals will store whatever values where associated with dupkey

 +Perl script generated from asp scripts should match line

<p>++All scripts are compiled as routines in a namespace uniquely defined by the global.asa of the ASP application.

 +Improved docs on $Response-&#62;Cookies() and $Request-&#62;Cookies()

 +Added PERFORMANCE doc to main README, and added sub section
  on precompiling scripts with Apache::ASP-&#62;Loader()

 +Naming of CompileIncludes switched over to DynamicIncludes 
  for greater clarity.

 +Dynamic includes can now reference ASP objects like $Session
  w/o the $main::* syntax.  These subs are no longer anonymous
  subs, and are now compiled into the namespace of the global.asa package.

 +Apache::ASP-&#62;Loader() precompiles dynamic includes too. Making this work
  required fixing some subtle bugs / dependencies in the compiling process.

 +Added Apache::ASP-&#62;Loader() similar to Apache::RegistryLoader for
  precompiling ASP scripts.  Precompile a whole site at server 
  startup with one function call.

 +Prettied the error messaging with Debug 2.

 +$Response-&#62;Debug(@args) debugging extension, which
  allows a developer to hook into the module&#39;s debugging,
  and only have @args be written to error_log when Debug is greater
  than 0.

 -Put write locking code around State writes, like $Session
  and $Application.  I thought I fixed this bug a while ago.

 -API change: converted $Session-&#62;Timeout() and $Session-&#62;SessionID() 
  methods into $Session-&#62;{Timeout} and $Session-&#62;{SessionID} properties.
  The use of these properties as methods is deprecated, but 
  backwards compatibility will remain.  Updated ./eg/session.asp
  to use these new properties.

 +Implemented $Response-&#62;{PICS} which if set sends out a PICS-Label
  HTTP header, useful for ratings.

 +Implemented $Response-&#62;{CacheControl} and $Response-&#62;{Charset} members.
  By default, CacheControl is &#39;private&#39;, and this value gets sent out
  every request as HTTP header Cache-Control.  Charset appends itself
  onto the content type header.

 +Implemented $Request-&#62;BinaryRead(), $Request-&#62;{TotalBytes},
  documented them, and updated ./eg/form.asp for an example usage. 

 +Implemented $Response-&#62;BinaryWrite(), documented, and created
  and example in ./eg/binary_write.htm

 +Implemented $Server-&#62;MapPath() and created example of its use
  in ./eg/server.htm

 -$Request-&#62;Form() now reads file uploads correctly with 
  the latest CGI.pm, where $Request-&#62;Form(&#39;file_field&#39;) returns
  the actual file name uploaded, which can be used as a file handle
  to read in the data.  Before, $Request-&#62;Form(&#39;file_field&#39;) would
  return a glob that looks like *Fh::filename, so to get the file
  name, you would have to parse it like =~ s/^\*Fh\:\://,
  which you no longer have to do.  As long as parsing was done as
  mentioned, the change should be backwards compatible.

 +Updated  +enhanced documentation on file uploads.  Created extra
  comments about it as an FAQ, and under $Response-&#62;Form(), the latter
  being an obvious place for a developer to look for it.

 +Updated ./eg/file_upload.asp to show use of non file form data, 
  with which we had a bug before.

 +Finished retieing *STDIN to cached STDIN contents, so that 
  CGI input routines may be used transparently, along side with
  use of $Request-&#62;Form()

 +Cleaned up and optimized $Request code

 +Updated documentation for CGI input &#38; file uploads.  Created
  file upload FAQ.

 +Reworked ./eg/cgi.htm example to use CGI input routines
  after doing a native read of STDIN.

 ++Added dynamic includes with &#60;!--include file=file args=@args--&#62;
  extension.  This style of include is compiled as an anonymous sub &#38; 
  cached, and then executed with @args passed to the subroutine for 
  execution.  This is include may also be rewritten as a new API 
  extension: $Response-&#62;Include(&#39;file&#39;, @args)

 +Added ./eg/compiled_includes.htm example documenting new dynamic includes.

 +Documented SSI: native file includes, and the rest with filtering 
  to Apache::SSI

 +Turned the documentation of Filter config to value of Off so 
  people won&#39;t cut and paste the On config by default.

 +Added SecureSession config option, which forces session cookie to 
  be sent only under https secured www page requests.

 +Added StateDB config option allows use of DB_File for $Session, since 
  default use of SDBM_File is limited.  See StateDB in README.

 +file include syntax w/o quotes supported like &#60;!--#include file=test.inc--&#62;

 +Nested includes are supported, with includes including each other.
  Recursive includes are detected and errors out when an include has been 
  included 100 times for a script.  Better to quit early than 
  have a process spin out of control. (PORTABLE ? probably not)

 +Allow &#60;!--include file=file.inc--&#62; notation w/o quotes around file names

 -PerlSetEnv apache conf setting now get passed through to 
  $Request-&#62;ServerVariables. This update has ServerVariables 
  getting data from %ENV instead of $r-&#62;cgi_env

<pre class="sh_perl"> ++SSI with Apache::Filter &#38; Apache::SSI, see config options &#38; ./eg files
  Currently filtering only works in the direction Apache::ASP -&#62; Apache::SSI,
  will not work the other way around, as SSI must come last in a set of filters

 +SSI file includes may reference files in the Global directory, better 
  code sharing

 - &#60;% @array... %&#62; no longer dropped from code.

 +perl =pod comments are stripped from script before compiling, and associated
  PodComments configuration options.

 +Command line cgi/asp script takes various options, and allows execution
  of multiple asp scripts at one time.  This script should be used for
  command line debugging.  This is also the beginning of building
  a static site from asp scripts with the -b option, suppressing headers.

 +$Response-&#62;AddHeader(&#39;Set-Cookie&#39;) works for multiple cookies.

 -$Response-&#62;Cookies(&#39;foo&#39;, &#39;0&#39;) works, was dropping 0 because of boolean test

 -fixes file locking on QNX, work around poor flock porting

 +removed message about Win32::OLE on UNIX platforms from Makefile.PL

 -Better lock garbage collection.  Works with StatINC seamlessly.

 -Multiple select forms now work in array context with $Response-&#62;Form()
        @values = $Response-&#62;Form(&#39;multi&#39;);

 -Better CGI.pm compatibility with $r-&#62;header_out(&#39;Content-type&#39;),

<pre class="sh_perl"> +Application_OnStart &#38; Application_OnEnd event handlers support.

 -Compatible with CGI.pm 2.46 headers() 

 -Compatible with CGI.pm $q = new CGI({}), caveat: does not set params 

 +use strict; followed by use of objects like $Session is fine.

 -Multiple cookies may be set per script execution.

 +file upload implemented via CGI.pm

 ++global.asa implemented with events Session_OnStart and Session_OnEnd
  working appropriately.

 +StateDir configuration directive implemented.
  StateDir allows the session state directory to be specified separately 
  from the Global directory, useful for operating systems with caching file 
  systems.

 +StateManager config directive.  StateManager specifies how frequently
  Sessions are cleaned up, with 10 (default) meaning that old Sessions
  will be cleaned up 10 times per SessionTimeout period (default 20 minutes).

 +$Application-&#62;SessionCount() implemented, non-portable method.
        : returns the number of currently active sessions

 -STOP button fix.  Users may hit STOP button during script 
  execution, and Apache::ASP will cleanup with a routine registered
  in Apache&#39;s $r-&#62;register_cleanup.  Works well supposedly.

 +PerlScript compatibility work, trying to make ports smoother.
        : Collection emulator, no -&#62;{Count} property
        : $.*(.*)-&#62;{Item} parsed automatically, 
          shedding the -&#62;{Item} for Collection support (? better way ?)
        : No VBScript dates support, just HTTP RFC dates with HTTP::Date
        : Win32::OLE::in not supported, just use &#34;keys %{$Collection}&#34;  

 +./cgi/asp script for testing scripts from the command line
        : will be upgraded to CGI method of doing asp
        : is not &#34;correct&#34; in anyway, so not documented for now
          but still useful

<pre class="sh_perl"> +Added PERFORMANCE doc, which includes benchmarks  +hints.

 +Better installation warnings and errors for other modules required. 

 -Turned off StatINC in eg/.htaccess, as not everyone installs Devel::Symdump

 -Fixed AUTOLOAD state bug, which wouldn&#39;t let you each through state
  objects, like %{$Session}, or each %$Session, (bug introduced in v.04)

 +Parses ASP white space better.  HTML output matches author&#39;s intent
  by better dealing with white space surrounding &#60;% perl blocks %&#62;

 -Scalar insertion code &#60;%=$foo%&#62; can now span many lines.

 +Added include.t test script for includes.

 +Script recompiles when included files change.

 +Files can be included in script with 
  SSI &#60;!--#include file=&#34;filename&#34;--&#62; syntax, needs to be
  done in ASP module to allow compilation of included code and html

 +Optimized ASP parsing, faster and more legible executing code
        : try &#39;die();&#39; in code with setting PerlSetVar Debug 2

 +Cleaned up code for running with &#39;use strict&#39;

 -Fixed directory handle leak on Solaris, from not closing after opendir()

 +StatINC overhaul.  StatINC setting now works as it should, with 
  the caveat that exported functions will not be refreshed.

 +NoState setting optimization, disallows $Application &#38; $Session

 +$Application-&#62;*Lock() functions implemented

 -SoftRedirect setting for those who want scripts to keep running
  after a Redirect()

 +SessionSerialize setting to lock session while script is running
        : Microsoft ASP style session locking
        : For a session, scripts execute one at a time 
        : NOT recommended use, please see note.

 -MLDBM can be used for other things without messing up internal use
        : before if it was used with different DB&#39;s and serializers,
          internal state could be lost.

 --State file locking.  Corruption worries, and loss of data no more.

 +CGI header support, developer can use CGI.pm for *output*, or just print()
        : print &#34;Set-Cookie: test=cookie\n&#34;, and things will just work
        : use CGI.pm for output
        : utilizes $r-&#62;send_cgi_header(), thanks Doug!

 +Improved Cookie implementation, more flexible and complete
        - Domain cookie key now works
        : Expire times now taken from time(), and relative time in sec
        : Request-&#62;Cookies() reading more flexible, with wantarray()
          on hash cookie values, %hash = $Request-&#62;Cookie(&#39;test&#39;);

 --------------
 Initial release, could be considered alpha software.
 Allows developers to embed perl in html ASP style.

 &#60;% for(1..10) { %&#62;

 ASP Objects
 -----------
 $Session, $Application, $Response, $Request objects available
 for use in asp pages.

 $Session &#38; $Application data is preserved using SDBM files.

 $Session id&#39;s are tracked through the use of cookies.

 Security
 --------
 Timeouts any attempt to use a session id that doesn&#39;t already 
 exist.  Should stop hackers, since there is no wire speed guessing
 cookies.</pre>
