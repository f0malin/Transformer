    - Make irand() and rand() 2.5x faster.
    - Now, if you specify $Math::Random::Secure::RNG before
      calling srand(), the "seeder" of $Math::Random::Secure::RNG
      will be used by srand() instead of srand() overriding the seeder
      and using the default one found by Math::Random::Secure::RNG.
    - Remove META.yml, in an attempt to make CPAN.pm install this
      module properly (this is an attempt to force CPAN.pm to read the dynamic
      dependencies for this module).

    - Require Crypt::Random::Source 0.07 to avoid various bugs and
      warnings.
    - Fix the version requirements for Windows so that CPAN will install
      the proper prerequisites there.

    - Clear the seed after the first call to rand() or irand(), so
      that an attacker can't inspect the state of the RNG to determine
      the seed.
    - Only seed ourselves with 64 bytes (512 bits) intead of 1024 bytes
      (8192 bits). The author of ISAAC says that this is safe.
    - Add POD explaining seed sizes and the importance of seed randomness.
    - Warn users if they pass in a bad seed or set seed_size too small.
    - Fix some small code and POD issues (thanks to LpSolit)

    - Remove the modulo bias from irand().
    - Add a test that proves the uniformity of generated values.
    - Update the POD quite a bit.

0.01 Tue Dec 28 2011
    - First release. Uses ISAAC as a backend and Crypt::Random::Source
      for seed data.
