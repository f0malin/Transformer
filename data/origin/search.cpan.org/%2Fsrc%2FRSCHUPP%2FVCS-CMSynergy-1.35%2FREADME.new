VCS::CMSynergy -- Perl interface to Telelogic Synergy

This module is a Perl interface to Telelogic Synergy (at various
times also known as Continuus/CM, CM Synergy or SYNERGY/CM),
a change and configuration management system from Telelogic AB
(http://www.telelogic.com).  It is implemented on top of the Synergy CLI,
hence you must have the command line client ("ccm") installed to use it.

VCS::CMSynergy.pm has been tested in the following environments:

Client (where the Perl script runs)	Synergy server
OS, Perl version			OS, Synergy version
-----------------------------------	---------------------------

Linux 2.6, Perl 5.8.8			Linux 2.6, CM Synergy 6.4 SP1

Linux 2.6, Perl 5.10.0			Linux 2.6, CM Synergy 6.5 SP1

Linux 2.6, Perl 5.8.8			Linux 2.6, Synergy 7.1 

Windows XP SP2, ActiveState Perl 5.8.8	Linux 2.6, CM Synergy 6.4 SP1

Windows XP SP2, ActiveState Perl 5.10.0	Linux 2.6, CM Synergy 6.5 SP1

Windows XP SP2, Cygwin Perl 5.10.0      Linux 2.6, CM Synergy 6.5 SP1

Windows XP SP2, ActiveState Perl 5.10.0	Linux 2.6, Synergy 7.1

NOTE: `make test' currently fails for Synergy 6.4 SP1 and higher if you
run it against the tutorial database that comes with these releases
(this is due to the total makeover of the tutorial database in 6.4
SP1). It succeeds when run it against a pre-6.4-SP1 tutorial database
(of course upgraded to your actual Synergy version).



BUILDING

Unpack the distribution, change to its top level directory, and then

    perl Makefile.PL
    make

On Win32 systems, replace "make" in the commands with "nmake". 
The nmake utility is included in Microsoft Visual Studio products.
An older version can be downloaded from 
http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/Nmake15.exe

TESTING

Make sure that the CM Synergy command client is installed and working:

  - check your setting of the CCM_HOME environment variable
  - test the installation with

    $CCM_HOME/bin/ccm version

You will need a pristine copy of the "tutorial" database to test the
module. The pack file for the "tutorial" database is distributed with
the CM Synergy product and is located in $CCM_HOME/packfiles/tutorial.cpk. 
Have your friendly CM Synergy administrator create a test database,
say /ccmdb/test_module, by executing

    $CCM_HOME/bin/ccmdb_unpack $CCM_HOME/packfiles/tutorial.cpk /ccmdb/test_module

and have her add you as a user to this database, currently the "developer"
role is sufficient to run the tests. Set the environemnt variable
CCM_TEST_DB to the name of the test database, e.g. (in Bourne shell syntax)

    CCM_TEST_DB=/ccmdb/test_module; export CCM_TEST_DB

If you are testing on Windows, you must also set the environment
variable CCM_TEST_USER to "user/password@host" which correspond
to the "ccm" options "-n", "-pw", and "-h", resp.
Run the tests with

    make test

If everything looks OK, install the module with

    make install
