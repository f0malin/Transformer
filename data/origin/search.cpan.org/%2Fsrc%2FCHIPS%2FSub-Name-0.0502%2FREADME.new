Module documentation:

NAME
    Sub::Name - (re)name a sub

SYNOPSIS
        use Sub::Name;

        subname $name, $subref;

        $subref = subname foo => sub { ... };

DESCRIPTION
    This module has only one function, which is also exported by default:

  subname NAME, CODEREF
    Assigns a new name to referenced sub. If package specification is
    omitted in the name, then the current package is used. The return value
    is the sub.

    The name is only used for informative routines (caller, Carp, etc). You
    won't be able to actually invoke the sub by the given name. To allow
    that, you need to do glob-assignment yourself.

    Note that for anonymous closures (subs that reference lexicals declared
    outside the sub itself) you can name each instance of the closure
    differently, which can be very useful for debugging.
